- For Commencement Year 2020 to 2021 - please refer to: 3757.1 Bachelor of Advanced Science
- For Commencement Year 2016 to 2019 - please refer to: 3562.9 Bachelor of Science (Advanced Science)
- For Commencement Year 2012 to 2019 - please refer to: 3683.1 Bachelor of Natural Science (Advanced)
- If you enjoy being constantly challenged and extended by your studies and are thinking about a career involving Science research, then the Bachelor Advanced Science degree allows exposure to research in an undergraduate degree. Inquiry-based research is introduced for all science students in first year, however in second year, Advanced Science students interact with world renowned researchers to provide extensive and individual training to develop leadership and/or research skills. This involves completing advanced science subjects only available to Advanced Science students, which focus on research methodology and developing skills pertinent for  a future in science project management. On completing a science major, the degree also allows for completion of an additional minor or four electives, so students can design their own learning journey.
- Students choosing the Environmental Health testamur major must complete a compulsory work placement.
- Students should note that different majors are offered on different campuses, and not all majors will be offered at every campus.
- Study Mode
- Three years full-time or six years part-time.

- Accreditation
- The Environmental Health major, when undertaken within the Bachelor of Advanced Science has Conditional Provisional Accreditation with Environmental Health Australia.
- Work Integrated Learning
- Students who select T076 Environmental Health testamur major must complete a compulsory work placement.  Please contact the Program Advisor listed above for information.
- Work integrated learning is a component of many subjects in the core of the course and testamur majors. Additionally, students will be allocated to or, depending on the testamur major selected, may choose one of three specific work integrated learning subjects.
- The first of these, Complex Case Studies in Science, is designed to provide students with opportunities for personal development, industry and civic engagement and to develop career readiness. The subject assures that students can critically analyse and logically argue complex scientific issues whilst taking into account multiple competing perspectives and builds on employability and communication skills developed in earlier subjects.
- Complex Forensic Studies is the second specific work integrated learning subject. Students in T049 Forensic Science will undertake Complex Forensic Studies which assures similar skills to those in Complex Case Studies but in a specific forensic science context.
- Admission
- Assumed Knowledge: Students should have at least 2 Unit English, 2 Unit science (any science) and 2 Unit mathematics at year 12 equivalent. Minimum ATAR of 90.
- Students must maintain a Grade Point Average (GPA) of 5.0 or above to continue their enrolment in the program. If this GPA is not maintained they will be automatically transferred into the standard program after one warning (one semester of further study). Students in other WSU science programs who achieve a GPA of 5.0 or greater at the end of their first year of study may be admitted into the Advanced Science program by invitation if sufficient places are available.
