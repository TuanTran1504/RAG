- Previous code: SM3128.1
- This minor aims to prepare eco-socially aware students for roles in a wide range of industries and to deal with environmental and humanitarian problems created as a result of industrial and other human activities. Students from different disciplines examine sustainability issues from environmental, humanities and economical angles and work together on “real world” problems supported by academics and industry partners.  In evaluating the social and environmental impacts, students gain essential skills in decision-making, designing and manufacturing products in a sustainable and equitable manner. Students learn to apply a holistic approach to solving problems in the ongoing automation of manufacturing and industrial practices in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (or Industry 4.0).
- This minor is a Challenge Minor, which is an innovative transdisciplinary minor co-created with students as partners. With a Challenge Minor, your learning reaches beyond your discipline, giving you the chance to amplify your learning in new directions. For more information, visit the Challenge Minor website.
