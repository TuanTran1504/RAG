- Program Status:
- This program applies to students who commenced in 2020 or later.
- Please note, that as of 2024, this program is an EXIT ONLY, no entry.
- The Graduate Diploma in Advanced Imaging aims to evaluate regional human anatomy and pathological findings to distinguish normal and pathological Magnetic Resonance (MR) images; to analyse the principles, techniques, procedures and aspects of MR imaging practices and image formation. Graduates will become equipped with the skills to design MR protocols relevant to patientsâ€™ clinical needs and employ the technology to provide quality imaging with high diagnostic confidence. There will be face-to-face or video-conferencing intensive workshops and interactions with specialists from different medical disciplines.
- The course is offered as part-time study and provides two weeks clinical training in a WSU endorsed MRI clinical site for each of the clinical units (ie a total of six weeks).
- Early Exit
- Students may exit this program on completion of 40 credit points with a 4769 Graduate Certificate in Advanced Imaging (MRI)
- Study Mode
- Two years part-time

- Work Integrated Learning
- There is a mandatory work component required for completion of this program.  Please contact the Program Advisor listed above for information.
- International students should also refer to the link below for more information and a link to the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS).
- Work Integrated Learning (WIL) for international students
- Clinical practice is essential to complement program objectives. It is expected that students will use workplace hours to meet the clinical practice requirements. However, if students do not currently work in the field, or are unable to organise their own clinical placement at an authorised accredited site, an optional work-based practical training unit located at Blacktown-Mount Druitt Hospital or other approved location has been developed.
- Supervision requirements are by placement agreement, covering contact and learning requirements, including assessment. The Teaching team will check in with students during the course of their practicum.
- Admission
- Applicants must be a Registered medical practitioner, registered dentist, (with AHPRA) or Vet registered with the Veterinary Practitioners Registration Board of NSW or equivalent;
- or Registered Medical Radiation Practitioner (with AHPRA):
- or must have completed an Undergraduate degree in medical science, engineering, or other health practitioner degrees.
- This program requires students to have a strong academic background in maths and physics. Applicants may be requested to demonstrate their competency if this is not evident within their undergraduate studies.
- Candidates may exit the program at the Graduate certificate level (40 Credit Points)
- Applicants who have undertaken studies overseas may have to provide proof of proficiency in English. Local and International applicants who are applying through the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC) will find details of minimum English proficiency requirements and acceptable proof on the UAC website. Local applicants applying directly to the University should also use the information provided on the UAC website.
