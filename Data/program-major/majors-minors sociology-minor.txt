- The minor in Sociology provides students with a thorough training in the methods, theories and select leading areas of contemporary sociology. As well as subjects in which methods and theories are taught, through the social science core, students enrolled in the Sociology minor will have opportunities to study a number of particular themes from a sociological perspective, including inequalities, deviance, identities, gender, religion, medicine and health care, ethnicity and migration, and the family, among other possibilities. A Bachelor of Social Science (BSS) with a minor in Sociology will prepare students for both employment and a research higher degree.
