- The right to safe drinking water and sanitation is an internationally recognized human right and integral to the realization of other human rights. Efficient water management will be key to this in the future as well as providing adequate food, health and well-being, and preserving our natural environments and ecosystems. This specialisation uses a transdisciplinary approach to developing sustainable solutions to current problems with water resourcing and to equip graduates with the tools to tackle future difficulties in water management. It is expected that upon completion of the program students will have the cognitive, technical and critical thinking skills to analyse issues and articulate appropriate solutions in the complex field of water sustainability. A capstone subject involving either a research or professional industry project will allow students to integrate their knowledge and skills developed throughout the program.
