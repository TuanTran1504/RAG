- This program applies to students who commenced in 2022 or later.
- Students should follow the program structure for the session start date relevant to the year they commenced.
- For Commencement Year 2020 to 2021 - please refer to: 3754.1 Bachelor of Science
- Science asks questions about how the natural world works and the impact of humans at its interface. It does so in a systematic, yet rigorously creative way based on inquiry and evidence. A Bachelor of Science will prepare you to take part in this process of inquiry, by both contributing to it and by using scientific knowledge to solve current problems in broad settings. Students will learn core concepts and skills investigating the natural world, proposing and testing ideas by experimentation and observation; quantifying and modelling processes; communicating findings, thinking independently and critically. Students can enrol in this degree and select from a range of scientific disciplines with the option of expanding learning into other areas outside of science.
- Students choosing T076 Environmental Health, Testamur Major must complete a compulsory work placement.
- All students must complete 60 credit points of study at Level 3 to meet program requirements. Depending on the major selected, students may need to select at least 10 credit points of elective study at Level 3 to meet this requirement.
- Students need to note that different majors are offered on different campuses, and not all majors will be offered at every campus.
- Study Mode
- Three years full-time or six years part-time.

- Accreditation
- T076 Environmental Health when undertaken within the Bachelor of Science has Conditional Provisional Accreditation with Environmental Health Australia.
- Work Integrated Learning
- Students who select T076 Environmental Health testamur major must complete a compulsory work placement.  Please contact the Program Advisor listed above for information.
- Work integrated learning is a component of many subjects in the core of the course and testamur majors. Additionally, students will be allocated to or, depending on the testamur major selected, may choose one of three specific work integrated learning subjects.
- The first of these, Complex Case Studies in Science, is designed to provide students with opportunities for personal development, industry and civic engagement and to develop career readiness. The subject assures that students can critically analyse and logically argue complex scientific issues whilst taking into account multiple competing perspectives and builds on employability and communication skills developed in earlier subjects.
- Complex Forensic Studies is the second specific work integrated learning subject. Students in T049 Forensic Science will undertake Complex Forensic Studies which assures similar skills to those in Complex Case Studies but in a specific forensic science context.
- Admission
- Assumed Knowledge: Students should have at least two unit English, and two unit science (any science) and two unit mathematics at year 12 equivalent.
