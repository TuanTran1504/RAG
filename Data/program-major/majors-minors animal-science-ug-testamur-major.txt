- As interactions with animals increase, so too does our need to effectively manage these populations. Animal scientists use scientific principles to solve problems associated with our relationship with and the management of animals in a changing world. In this major, you will develop a deep understanding of how we use animals for food, companionship and recreation by applying core principles ranging from nutrition and reproduction, through to behaviour and welfare. You will have access to diverse on-campus animal facilities including reptiles, native mammals, sheep, cattle and deer and off-campus organisations such as wildlife parks, zoos and farms. A variety of exciting career paths are available to graduates of this program, including international opportunities in the management of wildlife, companion animals and livestock.
- NOTE: This major is available as an elective in Bachelor of Science 3754, and an elective major option in Bachelor of Medical Science 3755. See the related programs tab for more information.
- Please note, the BSc Major Environmental Health T076, BSc Adv 3757, Bachelor of Science (Pathway to Teaching Primary/Secondary) 3756 & BMedSc Adv 3758, do not have sufficient Flexible space to accommodate a second/elective Major.
