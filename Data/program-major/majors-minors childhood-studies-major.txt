- Childhood Studies is a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary field that explores the meanings of childhood as a social category and researches children’s lives and experiences. The child, children’s rights and wellbeing are identified by UNICEF as central to the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This major allows students to analyse the intersection of childhood with other significant categories of social difference and to contribute to community and policy responses that impact children’s lives, rights and wellbeing. The major is valuable for students who seek a career in teaching or other career that involves working with, thinking critically about or researching children.
