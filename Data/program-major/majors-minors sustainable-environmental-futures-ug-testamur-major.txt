- Please note, the BSc Major Environmental Health T076, BSc Adv 3757, Bachelor of Science (Pathway to Teaching Primary/Secondary) 3756 & BMedSc Adv 3758, do not have sufficient Flexible space to accommodate a second/elective Major.
- Managing our environment sustainably requires professionals who are trained in new technologies across multiple disciplines, including biological and physical sciences, risk assessment, policy and management. Understanding how life interacts with water, soil and the atmosphere empowers us to develop sustainable management solutions for our most pressing environmental challenges. You will learn how to apply fundamental scientific knowledge to evaluate and mitigate the impacts of human activities on natural and managed ecosystems, including the built environment. You will have access to world class ecological and environmental research facilities, and will engage in hands-on, field-based learning, taught by a team at the cutting edge of research in this field. As a graduate, you are prepared for a career in environmental management, consultancy and biological conservation. All students must complete 60 credit points of study at Level 3 to meet course requirements. Students will need to select at least 10 credit points of elective study at Level 3 to meet this requirement.
