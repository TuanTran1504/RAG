- The Health and Physical Education (HPE) program brings together a comprehensive foundation of health sciences, understanding of physical activity, and skills in interacting with people. The program explores challenging areas of personal development, including youth health issues, sexuality, drugs, psychology and risk-taking behaviours, as well as general health science, including human biology, health systems, health promotion and research. Facilities are state of the art, including a new gymnasium and a renovated dance and gym studio, and practical experience is a strong feature of the program. The program is a popular pathway to a Master of Teaching degree, and then on to a teaching career. Teaching opportunities can be extended beyond HPE by studying electives, such as science and mathematics, where students gain a second teaching area in a subject of their choice. Graduates also work as personal trainers, sports coaches, research assistants, and community-based recreation.
