- Public health is the science of disease prevention, prolonging life and improving health for individuals and their communities. This work is achieved by promoting healthy lifestyles, researching disease prevention, conducting population health assessment and measurement, improving environmental health, engaging the community and detecting, preventing and responding to infectious diseases. Public Health graduates work in a variety of settings, including national and state health departments, community organisations and the global health sector. The Public Health major builds a student’s knowledge of the biological, social, cultural, economic and physical factors that underpin the health of a population and how to promote health for all. Students will also develop and use skills in epidemiology and biostatistics, surveillance and prevention, and public health policy. The major includes 140 hours of professional practice placement. This Testamur Major will be identified on the Student’s Testamur following completion of the course.
