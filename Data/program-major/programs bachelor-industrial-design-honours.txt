- Handbook Summary 2023
- The Honours Design Research pathway is developed to meet the demands of communities, industries, and academia in creating new applied design research contributions to the societal body of knowledge in creativity, innovation, systems and design thinking, and social innovation.
 
The curriculum offers structured and self-directed learning across standard class formats, studio-based, blended, online and experiential Work Integrated Learning. At the culmination of the program the final year Thesis Projects are showcased in the Annual Widevision School Excellence Exhibition for industry and employer engagement providing a unique, career enhancing, engagement and networking opportunity.
 
With a focus on advanced design research methods drawn from industry-based design practice graduates are provided with multi-directional employment pathways. Students can choose to transition to a research pathway such as Masters and PhD studies or to an industry or entrepreneurial career in their chosen area of research specialisation. Studies are held at the Parramatta Engineering Innovation Hub.
- Effective industrial design research career professionals require a broad range of knowledge to allow them to connect and work with colleagues across many disciplines. To assist students to flexibly build their career pathways, the Bachelor of Industrial Design (Honours) provides elective options in order to complete an industrial design major; one or two minors; or explore a range of free electives in areas of interest outside of industrial design.
