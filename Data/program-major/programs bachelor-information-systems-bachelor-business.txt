- This program applies to students who commenced in 2018 or later.
- The Bachelor of Information Systems/Bachelor of Business provides students with knowledge and understanding of two very closely related fields. The advantage of this degree is that it will help open doors to entrepreneurship, start-up companies and new innovations that will require business knowledge and cutting edge information systems and technology skills. The business component of the double degree will allow students to gain knowledge in one of three core Business areas:
- The Money area encompasses majors in Applied Finance and Economics, while Markets centre on majors in Hospitality, Sport Management, International Business and Marketing. Finally the Management area includes majors in Human Resources and Management. Four business core subjects introduce students to fundamental aspects of law in a commercial context, management, the basics of financing and accounting needs of an organisation, and an introduction to markets and marketing. A number of professional core subjects compliment and build on previous knowledge and skills in the areas of numeracy, creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship, leadership and further enhance student’s employability by offering internship or client-based problem solving subjects. A choice from eight business majors will add to the in-depth knowledge and equip students with the skills to pursue a career in a chosen area of interest. Students’ knowledge is augmented with study in the Information Systems domain including, but not limited to, system analysis and design, information systems, programming, database design and development, networking, system deployment and management, web and mobile development and social computing. In pursuing this combination of study, students will learn how to assume corporate roles in global enterprises as well as gain skills needed to start a business. This double degree will equip students with the tools to become future entrepreneurs, to innovate, engage in new business developments, implement new business models and propose technology enhanced start-ups.
