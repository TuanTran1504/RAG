It is designed to increase students’ preparedness for PhD studies and ultimately for research-orientated careers.
- The first year is comprised of advanced Bachelor level studies exposing students to comprehensive research methodology and advanced disciplinary coursework. Students will develop a research proposal, improve their academic literacy skills and engage with issues associated with research ethics and integrity. In the second year students will undertake a supervised year of higher degree research and produce a Masters thesis. The second year also includes a series of workshops and seminars designed to enhance students’ research and professional capabilities.
