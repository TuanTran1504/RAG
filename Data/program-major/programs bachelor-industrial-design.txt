- Handbook Summary 2023
- Industrial Designers are innovation leaders working across collaborative teams within design consultancies and across a multitude of client-based projects in a wide array of fields. In this program students will experience Advanced and Additive Manufacturing and develop the design skills to maximise the outcomes for brands, products, and positive environmental impacts.
 
Students work collaboratively, in teams and with clients, on industry projects whilst utilising the extensive Design Studio and Advanced Prototyping Workshop facilities available to them. At the culmination of the program students will have the opportunity to have their capstone Project showcased in the Annual Widevision School Excellence Exhibition for industry and employer engagement providing a unique career enhancing, and networking opportunity.
 
This program places graduates at the forefront of developing new user experiences and high-level outcomes in brand management, marketing and manufacturing. Graduate opportunities range from working with consumer products such as medical devices, advanced packaging and sustainable circular products, to high technology industries including wearables, space, and IoT enabled interfaces. Studies are held at the Parramatta Engineering Innovation Hub.
