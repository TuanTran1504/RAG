- A Zoology major provides you with the opportunity to study Australia’s unique animals and their habitats. Zoologists have a detailed understanding of the diversity of the animal kingdom and are equipped with scientific understanding of how animals function and interact with their environment: ranging from their ecology, behaviour and evolution, to the physiology and biochemistry of cells, tissues and major organ systems. Zoology underpins conservation and sustainability, including major contributions to current research in climate change and ecosystem management. On-campus animal facilities include those for reptiles, small marsupials and rodents, sheep and cattle, as well as over 1000ha of native, rural and aquatic habitats with an abundance of native wildlife. Zoologists graduate with practical laboratory and fieldwork skills that prepare them for a wide variety of vocations in this field.
