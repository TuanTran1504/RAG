- Mechanical engineering is a dynamic area involving the design and build of moving machines including engines that power transportation, industrial machinery, and a range of tools. Students put the core concepts of mechanical engineering, energy, thermodynamics, mechanics, kinematics, and fluid mechanics, into practical application in workshops, industry projects, and work integrated learning. Students design and construct machines and tools, monitor and evaluate their performance. Employment opportunities include automotive or mechanical engineer, control and instrumentation engineer. This major includes a mandatory 12 weeks of industrial placement as a completion requirement.

Note: All students are required to enrol in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary first and undertake a readiness test at the beginning of their study.

This test will be conducted at the beginning of the first semester of enrolment and the result will determine whether a student will remain in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary or be transferred by the School to MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1.

The students who finish MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary will then use this unit as an elective.
