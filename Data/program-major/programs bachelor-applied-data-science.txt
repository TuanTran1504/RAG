- Digital data plays an increasingly important role in many areas of endeavour. Extracting information from data has become a science in itself – Data Science. Graduates from many disciplines, will benefit from skills in Data Science. This program teaches a blend of skills from mathematics, statistics and computing, Graduates will know how to embark on data driven investigations, and conduct visual and computational analytics for application in their own primary discipline.
- Study Mode
- Four years for students completing a three-year Western Sydney Bachelor degree and the Bachelor of Applied Data Science. Five years for students completing a four-year Western Sydney Bachelor degree and the Bachelor of Applied Data Science.
