- Western Sydney University Major Code:
- Previous Code: MT3041.1
- There is a high demand for mathematics teachers throughout Australia, with Western Sydney identified as a particular high-demand location by the NSW Department of Education. Building on the Bachelor of Mathematics, this major equips graduates with additional knowledge and skills in contemporary educational concepts. After completing the Bachelor of Mathematics (Secondary Education), graduates can enrol in a postgraduate course to become accredited teachers. The core subjects of the Bachelor of Mathematics meet the NESA requirements for Mathematics as a first teaching area, and students can choose elective subjects to qualify for another teaching area to gain additional options for employment.
- Location
- Major Structure
- All students must complete Education Studies, Minor plus four subjects from one of the alternate pools.
- A minimum of 30 credit points at Level 3 is required across all Secondary Teaching major subjects.
- Note: The core subjects of 3778 Bachelor of Mathematics meet the NESA requirements for Mathematics as a first teaching area.
