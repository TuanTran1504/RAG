- Modern History includes the studies of societies, states and cultures since the Middle Ages and equivalent periods elsewhere. It provides important insights into the nature of the modern world, and into the origins of the features of modern life we now think of as ‘global’. Modern History is an important teaching area for students heading into for Secondary Teaching: the purpose of this major is to group together all of the subjects which count as Modern History for the purposes of the Master of Teaching program and the Institute of Teaching. Successful completion of the Modern History major will count as a first teaching area for Secondary Teaching. Note that there is a wider list of history subjects available in the History and Political Thought major.
