- The Secondary Teaching major is comprised of the four initial subjects from the Master of Teaching (Secondary) or three subjects from the Master of Teaching (Secondary) STEM. These subjects are broadly structured for students to investigate the underlying principles and concepts in adolescent development, diversity and social justice, skills in the design of learning experiences along these principles, and putting their application into practice. Available to all students in a Pathway to Teaching (Secondary) degree, enrolment is dependent on the successful completion of 160 credit points in the undergraduate program. Students are also offered the flexibility to study subject content subjects in either Modern History, Geography and Urban Studies, Mathematics, Studies of Religion or English to form their second teaching area. This major, together with a Business major articulates into a Master of Teaching postgraduate qualification in Secondary Teaching, and leads to opportunities for employment across Australia as well as internationally.
