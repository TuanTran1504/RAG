- The Music Performance minor offers students opportunities to expand and refine their performance practice. Through group rehearsal and performance, the two second-year subjects explore musical collaboration as performer-performer, and as performer-composer. Through student-devised projects, the two third-year subjects encourage engagement with theatrical, multimedia and/or electroacoustic elements as featured performer. In the capstone subject, students are challenged to present work of substantial duration that is industry-ready, drawing on skills from the rest of the minor. Aspects of onstage skills, performance persona, repertoire and interpretation, and audience communication are addressed. Subjects require writing about performance through project proposals, reflective and contextual essays, and an industry pitch. Students receive, and develop the capacity to give constructive feedback during workshops in each subject.
