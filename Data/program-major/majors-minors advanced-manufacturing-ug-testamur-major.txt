- Manufacturing is continuously transforming as it integrates automation, analytics, intelligence, digitalisation, and Internet of Things (IoT) into physical operations. In this major, students integrate techniques and methods to improve the sustainability and efficiency of manufacturing, taking advantage of digitisation tools. Students tackle complex problems, propose innovative solutions, and apply critical thinking to industry problems considering social, ethical and environmental factors. Job opportunities are varied and include Digital Product Design Engineer, Digital Process Engineer, Additive Manufacturing Engineer, Digital Twins Engineer, Systems Engineer, Automation Specialist, Robotics Specialists, Advanced Sensors Specialists, Industry 4.0 Transformation Specialist. All students complete a mandatory 300 to 450 hour industrial placement.
