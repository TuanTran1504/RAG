- Earth’s climate is warming and species are becoming extinct at a rate not seen for sixty-six million years. The climate and extinction crises are precipitating resource shortages and inter-societal conflict. Social groups small and large grapple with how to respond to this global crisis, and social principles of equity and justice are under strain. This transdisciplinary minor introduces students to climate justice, a principle of equitable economic and social responsibility for these crises. Moving across the HASS-STEM divide, students encounter multiple knowledges which critique ‘business-as-usual thinking’ and offer just methods for multispecies flourishing in the present and future.
- This minor is a Challenge Minor, which is an innovative transdisciplinary minor co-created with students as partners. With a Challenge Minor, your learning reaches beyond your discipline, giving you the chance to amplify your learning in new directions. For more information, visit the Challenge Minor website.
