- Climate change impacts across all sections of our society, from scientists who study the mechanisms underlying it, to businesses and policy makers who must deal with its effects and take remedial action. A factual understanding of climate, the components that go to make it up, and how climate has varied in the past, is essential for any person working in the climate change area. This specialisation will introduce students to the concept of climate, our understanding of how it works, and how it has changed through time. It will give students a critical understanding of current environmental concerns and debates about the greenhouse effect and climate change, and the science behind greenhouse gas accounting and potential effects on biota. Students completing the specialisation will be well positioned to make informed business decisions about greenhouse gas emissions and abatement.
