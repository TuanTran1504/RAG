- With an emphasis on studio-based practice, you will study areas such as image design, typography, layout design, branding, design history, research methods, and web-based design. From year two, you will develop a focus on digital design, photography, and graphics technology, enabling you to develop two teaching disciplines, Design & Technology and Graphics & Multimedia Technology. In year three, you will also study an Education Studies – Secondary Teaching minor, where you will gain an understanding of contemporary education issues, teaching and learning. Students who complete this degree are eligible for 40 credit points advanced standing (the first semester of the M Teaching (Secondary) or M Teaching (Secondary) STEM). As well as being equipped with the necessary elements of an initial teacher qualification, you will be prepared for professional graphic design practice and associated alternate employment opportunities in design.
