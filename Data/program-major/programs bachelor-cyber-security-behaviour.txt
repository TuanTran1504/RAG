- This program teaches you the technical components of cyber security, while emphasising the human behaviours that lead to poor cyber security practices. The program meets the pressing need for the application of behavioural sciences and research to understand cyber security issues in the context of decision-making, human errors, crime that deceives both humans and technical systems, social influence, organisational cultures and vulnerable populations. As cyber threats become more sophisticated and damaging across all types of organisations, cyber security has become one of the nation’s top priorities. Students will gain a solid grounding in conventional computer and network security concepts and skills, and will be exposed to elite training in what is known as Blue and Purple Teams – Cyber Defence and Incident Response. This program leads to a range of rewarding career options for graduates.  Examples include security architect, digital forensic officer, cyber intelligence, cyber safety officer, data security, security analyst, risk analytics, and cyber investigations.
