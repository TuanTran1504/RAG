- Handbook Summary 2020 - 2022
- The Master of Epidemiology program is designed for graduates interested in a career in health research, including clinicians (medical, nursing and allied health) and practitioners from health-related fields (public health, environmental health, communicable disease control). It provides an advanced understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods and their application in clinical, public health and health policy settings. A variety of electives allow acquisition of specialist skills and knowledge in areas including disease surveillance, research protocol design and statistical modelling. A capstone subject involving design and conduct of an epidemiological study, which may be workplace-based, allows students to integrate their knowledge and experiences from the whole program.

- Handbook Summary 2023
- The Master of Epidemiology Program is designed for graduates interested in a career in health research, including clinicians (medical, nursing and allied health) and practitioners from health-related fields (public health, environmental health, communicable disease control, global health, data science). It provides an advanced understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods and their application in clinical, population health and health policy settings. A variety of electives allow acquisition of specialist skills and knowledge in areas including disease surveillance, population health research, big data for and statistical modelling, climate change, and international development. A capstone Subject involving the design and conduct of an epidemiological study, which may be workplace-based or involve fieldwork, allows students to integrate their knowledge and experiences from the whole program.

- Work Integrated Learning (WIL) for international students
- Students may elect to complete an applied project subject and may engage their own, or some other workplace, to conduct a research project. This may involve fieldwork as part of project data collection, use of secondary data, or stakeholder engagement and would be negotiated by the student.
- The provisions of an applied project subject will require that students arrange a WSU Primary Supervisor and a non-WSU Co-supervisor (associated with the project setting). In instances where a research project is based within a workplace setting requiring workplace supervision, supervisors will be supported by ongoing contact with the Subject Coordinator, and the provision of supervisor guidelines and other information about the subject throughout its duration. Additionally any research protocol requiring ethics approval will be submitted to the WSU Human Research Ethics Committee prior to commencing an applied project.
