- The power of modern computers adds substantial clout to traditional mathematical and statistical techniques â€” provided that you know how to make use of the opportunities that computers offer. Building on the Bachelor of Mathematics, this major equips graduates with the skills to make the best use of computational tools. You will learn how to use computers effectively as a mathematician or a statistician, with a focus on efficiency, reliability, and security. These skills are absolutely indispensable if you consider enrolling for an HDR degree, but they will also help you make a case in your next job application.
