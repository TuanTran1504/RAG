- This degree combines Science with learning about Education. Science asks questions about how the natural world works and the impact of humans at its interface. It does so in a systematic, yet rigorously creative way based on inquiry and evidence for ideas. A Bachelor of Science will prepare you to take part in this process of inquiry, by both contributing to it and by using scientific knowledge to solve current problems in broad settings including in society.  Students will learn core concepts and skills investigating the natural world, proposing and testing ideas by experimentation and observation; quantifying and modelling processes; communicating findings, thinking independently and critically. Students can enrol in this degree and select from a range of scientific disciplines with the option of expanding learning into other areas outside of science. Students will also take 4 subjects in Education choosing to specialise in either secondary or primary school teaching Students will be offered a place into a Master of Teaching program on successful completion of the degree.
- All students must complete 60 credit points of study at Level 3 to meet course requirements. Depending on the major selected, students may need to select at least 10 credit points of elective study at Level 3 to meet this requirement.
- Students need to note that different majors are offered on different campuses, and not all majors will be offered at every campus.
- Study Mode
- Three years full-time or six years part-time.

- Please contact the Course Advisor listed above for information.
- Work integrated learning is a component of many subjects in the core of the course and testamur majors. Additionally, students will be allocated to or, depending on the testamur major selected, may choose one of three specific work integrated learning subjects.
- The first of these, Complex Case Studies in Science, is designed to provide students with opportunities for personal development, industry and civic engagement and to develop career readiness. The subject assures that students can critically analyse and logically argue complex scientific issues whilst taking into account multiple competing perspectives and builds on employability and communication skills developed in earlier subjects.
- Complex Forensic Studies is the second specific work integrated learning subject. Students in MT 3022 Forensic Science will undertake Complex Forensic Studies which assures similar skills to those in Complex Case Studies but in a specific forensic science context.
