- The Forensic Science Major provides students with specialised expertise in forensic science including methods of forensic analysis, crime scene investigation, forensic photography, forensic investigation, and complex case studies. Career opportunities include forensic scientists, crime scene investigators, private investigators and consultants, police officers, drug analysts, researchers and academics, and specialised forensic science practitioners. The main employers of forensic scientists are State and Federal police services, State and Commonwealth Government Health Departments and analytical chemistry laboratories. Graduates will be versatile with a wide skills base with (depending on their choice of electives) potential for employment in analytical chemistry and microbiology, quality control and assurance, biochemistry and molecular biology, scientific research, education and the chemical industry.  All students must complete 60 credit points of study at Level 3 to meet course requirements.
