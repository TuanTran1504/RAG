- The Health and Physical Education (HPE) program brings together a comprehensive foundation of health sciences, understanding of physical activity, and skills in interacting with people. The course explores challenging areas of personal development, including youth health, sexuality, drugs, mental health, risk-taking behaviours, health promotion and research. Facilities include a gymnasium, dance and gym studio, sports fields, and undercover sport courts where learning to lead practical experiences are a strong feature of the program. The program is a popular pathway to a Master of Teaching degree, and then on to a teaching career. Teaching opportunities can be extended beyond HPE by studying subjects in other disciplines to gain a second teaching area. Graduates also work as sport development officers, sports coaches, research assistants, and community-based recreation.
