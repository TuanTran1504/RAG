- Public health is the science of disease prevention, prolonging life and improving health for individuals and their communities. This work is achieved by promoting healthy lifestyles, researching disease prevention, conducting population health assessment and measurement, improving environmental health, engaging the community and detecting, preventing and responding to infectious diseases. Public health professionals are required to assess and respond to emerging public health issues and work in a variety of settings, including national and state health departments, community organisations and the global health sector. The Public Health major builds a student’s knowledge of the biological, social, cultural, economic and physical factors that underpin the health of a population and how to promote health for all. Students will also develop and use skills in epidemiology and biostatistics, surveillance and prevention, and public health policy. Students in T109 Clinical Science, who would not otherwise have the opportunity to take the 140- hour subject MEDI 3007 Professional Health Placement may choose to do so.
