- This program applies to students who commenced in 2017 or later.
- Handbook summary 2017-2023
- This program is an advanced version of Bachelor of Computer Science. It provides students with a thorough and in-depth technical understanding of modern decentralised computer systems. This understanding includes how these computer systems are put together, how they work and what are the principles that govern them. Based on this solid foundation, students then have the opportunity to further learn the practical skills needed to design, develop and integrate the decentralised computer systems required by today's large organisations. This program is a three year program with distinct majors which allow students to specialise in different applications of computer science and computer systems. Some of the majors are: Cyber Security, Networked Systems, Cloud Computing, Systems Programming, Artificial Intelligence and others.
- Students in the Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced) will follow the same study program that is set out for the Bachelor of Computer Science. However, each student in this program will have an academic mentor and the student will also participate in additional compulsory activities including research projects. To maintain their enrolment in the Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced) students must maintain an overall above 5 Grade Point Average, otherwise they will be transferred to the standard 3506 – Bachelor of Computer Science program. At enrolment students will be required to sign a declaration acknowledging the need to maintain a grade-point average (GPA) of 5.0 or more.
- Handbook summary 2024
- This program is designed for high performing students who are motivated to explore further in cutting-edge technology. In addition to computer science study which covers programming, data structure, algorithm, security, artificial intelligence, software design and development, the program provides student with independent learning and research training in advanced topics including algorithms, artificial intelligence, software engineering and security. Mentor will be assigned to each student. This program offers majors in Cyber Security, Artificial Intelligence, Systems Programming, Networked Systems, Technology Entrepreneurship, and a minor in Cloud Computing. 
Graduates of an advanced computer science program will be well-equipped to tackle complex computational problems and contribute to the development of innovative technologies. Career paths include software engineering, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and research in computer science.
Students are required to maintain a grade-point average (GPA) of 5.0 or more at every semester.
