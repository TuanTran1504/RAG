- Additional Information - School of Law guidelines for pathways to PhD
- 1. Currently the WSU Doctorate Policy eligibility requirement is found under Clause 11:
- Applicants for admission to candidature for any doctorate degree covered by this policy with the exception of a Doctor of Medicine (see Part R) shall hold:
• a research masters degree; or
• a bachelor degree with honours class 1 or bachelor degree with honours class 2 division 1; or
• qualifications from a university or other tertiary institution deemed by the Dean or Director, Research Institute to be equivalent to the requirements set out above.
- This guideline is to provide clarity over what the school of law determines as a research masters degree or equivalent qualifications from a University.
- 2. Please note this guideline does not impact Clause 12 which states: 
In exceptional circumstances a Dean or Director, Research Institute may approve the admission of an applicant who does not have the qualifications specified in clause 11. In such cases the Dean or Director, Research Institute will consider evidence to be supplied by the candidate and verified by the relevant HDR Director or equivalent, that shows that the applicant has equivalent qualifications based on academic and professional attainment and demonstration in an appropriate discipline of a capacity for the research. Evidence should demonstrate the applicant's understanding of and skill in the use of a suitable research methodology and ability to undertake academic writing. The Dean or Director, Research Institute may approve admission on the basis of equivalent capacity.” 
That clause allows the Dean or Director discretion where appropriate. 
 
3. For the purposes of the school of law Doctorate program eligibility a ‘research masters’ or ‘equivalent degree’ requires the candidate to have their qualifications assessed by the research committee. Considerations relevant to admission will include whether the candidate:
- • Has completed a 10,000-word minimum research project 
• Has had the research project examined by external markers 
• If given a grade be at least a Distinction/High Distinction.
• GPA in undergraduate law of the equivalent of an Honours 2:1 OR other study deemed suitable for equivalence
- If these are not met the candidate should enrol in the Research Masters. 
4. For JD and LLM students they should be advised to complete the dissertation subjects (LAWS7027 Legal Philosophy and Methodology and LAWS7062 Legal Research Dissertation) and have them externally marked along with meeting the other criteria.
