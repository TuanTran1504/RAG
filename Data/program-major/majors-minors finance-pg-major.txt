This major introduces students to these concepts, including the time value of money, risk and return, capital budgeting and capital structure – and to the tools of financial decision-making in the context of the Australian institutional environment. Students examine the investment, financing and dividend decisions of corporations and develop an understanding of the basic practices of financial management from the perspective of both large and small firms. Students will develop a strong financial compass and be enabled to make financial decisions with greater confidence.
