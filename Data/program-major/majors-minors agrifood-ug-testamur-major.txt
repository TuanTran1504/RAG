- Agrifood, Testamur Major (T123)
- Western Sydney University Major Code:
- Previous code:  MT3045.1
- This major is available as an elective in Bachelor of Science 3754 (except with Environmental Health T076), and an elective major option in Bachelor of Medical Science 3755. See the related programs tab for more information.
- Please note, the BSc Major Environmental Health T076, BSc Adv 3757, Bachelor of Science (Pathway to Teaching Primary/Secondary) 3756 & BMedSc Adv 3758, do not have sufficient Flexible space to accommodate a second/elective Major.
- Opportunities are rapidly emerging for you to lead a new AgriFood future. Immersed in an approach that integrates social, economic and environmental values, students will view plant and animal production from consumer contexts to explore personal and community perceptions about food sustainability. This innovative degree merges topics of agriculture, food and health to empower you to design solutions for international development, community education and the urban–rural interface. The WSU AgriFood major is a hands-on experience, developing confidence and giving graduates an excellent foundation for careers in teaching, research, biotechnology and industry. The flexibility of the major also enables students to combine their interest with other disciplines including animal science, ecology, zoology, innovative foods, heath and business. Throughout study, engagement with industry and community will inspire you to take action towards a regenerative and more environmentally sustainable AgriFood future.
