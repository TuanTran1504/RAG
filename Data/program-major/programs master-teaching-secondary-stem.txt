- The Master of Teaching (Secondary) STEM program is an accredited teaching qualification for students possessing an appropriate bachelor’s degree in a secondary subject area. It prepares graduates for careers in secondary school settings in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in NSW, other Australian states and internationally. The degree provides deep engagement in secondary STEM education, focusing on innovative and evidence-based approaches to teaching and learning and development of strong pedagogical content knowledge in STEM. It prepares students for their teaching career by emphasising pedagogical approaches and culturally responsive teaching practices that enable diverse learners to access learning experiences, effective classroom management practices, and using assessment and feedback to guide and enhance student learning.  Graduates meet the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers, required for registration with the NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA). The Graduate Diploma in Teaching (Secondary) STEM is an early exit point for students not seeking an accredited teaching qualification.
