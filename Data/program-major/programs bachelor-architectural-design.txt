This program of study aligns with the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia (AACA) National Standard of Competency for Architects in the areas of design, documentation, project delivery and practice management across five knowledge domains; regulatory, social and ethical, environmentally sustainable, communication and disciplinary. The program focuses on producing graduates who can synthesise and evaluate information from across associated disciplines, undertake architectural design and apply design thinking to complex projects in a global marketplace.
Effective career professionals require a broad range of understandings to allow them to connect and work with colleagues across many disciplines. To assist students to flexibly build their career pathways, the Bachelor of Architectural Design provides a range of free electives from areas of interest across the University in addition to opportunities to work alongside industry/community partners to consolidate their learning and develop invaluable career networks.
