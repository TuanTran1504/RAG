- The Accounting major equips you with the expert skills to create a career as an accounting specialist. You will be prepared to succeed in a range of roles in accounting practices, and also in both public and private enterprises. In this major you will develop in-depth knowledge of accounting, supported by knowledge of law, economics, and finance. Accounting major subjects focus on the fundamentals of financial and management accounting, as well as accounting information and corporate systems. If you are seeking professional accreditation, you will also undertake specialised subjects in taxation and audit and assurance. The core subjects in the Bachelor of Business will provide you a foundation of business knowledge and develop your skills in innovation, career planning, and numeracy. The Accounting major builds on this knowledge and skills in an applied discipline based context. Accountants are in high global demand by enterprises in corporate, public, and not-for-profit sectors. The Bachelor of Business (Accounting) (including online) is accredited with and satisfies the pre-admission educational requirements for membership of CPA Australia (CPA), Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ) and the Institute of Public Accountants (IPA). Completion of this degree will allow students to claim a number of exemptions from the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) in obtaining the CIMA Professional Qualification.
