- The Master of Teaching (Early Childhood and Primary) is a postgraduate initial teaching qualification that provides students with the flexibility to teach in both early childhood education and care settings and primary schools (Kindergarten to Year 6). This degree focuses on the continuity of children’s learning from birth to 12 years across all curriculum areas, as they transition through educational settings. Students will learn how to foster children's creativity, curiosity, imagination, critical thinking and wellbeing and to engender a love of learning across all curriculum areas. The program prepares students for their teaching career by emphasising evidence-based pedagogical approaches and culturally responsive teaching practices that enable diverse learners to access learning experiences, effective prosocial and classroom management practices, and using assessment and feedback to guide and enhance student learning. Students will explore the significance of the diversity of children’s family and community contexts and gain the knowledge and skills to foster meaningful partnerships. Pedagogical leadership will be developed through 60 days of professional experience in early childhood education and care settings, and 30 days in primary schools.
- Program Logic
- Foundation: Pre-service teachers will develop fundamental knowledge, skills, and attributes to support the beginning of their journey to become a teacher.
- Development: Pre-service teachers will strengthen their pedagogical content knowledge, understanding of classroom management, and evidence-based pedagogical practices.
- Transition: Pre-service teachers will consolidate and apply the knowledge, skills, and attributes required for success as a Graduate Teacher, using evidence to inform and strengthen pedagogical practice.
