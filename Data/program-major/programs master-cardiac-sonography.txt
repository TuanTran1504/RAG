- Accreditation
- This program is accredited with the Australian Sonographers Accreditation Registry.  Students will be eligible to be registered as a student sonographer, and upon graduating will be eligible to be an accredited cardiac sonographer. Graduates may also be eligible for professional membership with appropriate professional associations.
- Work Integrated Learning
- There is a mandatory work component required for completion of this program.  Please contact the Program Advisor listed above for information.
- International students should also refer to the link below for more information and a link to the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS).
- Work Integrated Learning (WIL) for international students
- Clinical training of a minimum three days in cardiac sonography each week (or 21 hours) is required for the duration of the program (as per entry requirements). This is necessary for program accreditation and will be made clear to all program applicants and reaffirmed when students are offered a conditional position in the program. Students are responsible for making these arrangements, which must be confirmed two weeks prior to the start of semester 1 year 1.
- When students are offered a conditional position in the program, they will be sent a clinical practice verification form, which is to be returned as soon as possible, so that measures to verify the suitability of the clinical experience can commence. That is, upon receipt of the signed verification form, the program coordinator will review the form to confirm that the student will have access to appropriate and supervised clinical training.
- Clinical supervisors (at the students’ site) will be provided with numerous means of support. Initially, they will be contacted by the program coordinator to verify their support for the student. They will receive a clinical supervisors guide and instructional video. Information about the content of program units and assessment items will be provided at the start of each semester, and prior to practical assessments at the end of each semester.
- Admission
- All Applicants must:
- Applicants who have undertaken studies overseas may have to provide proof of proficiency in English. Local and International applicants who are applying through the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC) will find details of minimum English proficiency requirements and acceptable proof on the UAC website. Local applicants applying directly to the University should also use the information provided on the UAC website.
