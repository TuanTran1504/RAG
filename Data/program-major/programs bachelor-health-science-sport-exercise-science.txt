- Sport and exercise science encompasses the science that underpins health, physical activity and exercise, and their applications to the design, implementation and evaluation of exercise programs. There are a range of career options in health and fitness centres, for example as a personal trainer, a health and fitness specialist or a fitness assessor, in government agencies associated with sport, physical activity and health, in teaching and research, and with professional sporting groups, rehabilitation clinics and hospitals. If you gain higher-level accreditation as an exercise physiologist, you will also be able to provide healthcare services funded by Medicare (Australian Government), pharmaceutical, health or food industries. Alternatively, graduates who elect studies in the physical sciences, mathematics or business are well placed for careers in the manufacturing industry.
- The program combines studies in exercise physiology, sports psychology, biomechanics motor control and exercise prescription with a broad understanding of biomedicine and various health science fields to develop the professional competencies important for ethical and safe practice and high quality care and the skills to work in multidisciplinary teams. Facilities are state-of-the-art, centred on an Exercise and Sport Science Laboratory complex, and practical experience is a strong feature of the program.
- Study Mode
- Three years full-time. Students may choose to study at a reduced load.
