From year two, you will develop a focus on digital design, photography, and graphics technology, enabling you to develop two teaching disciplines, Design & Technology and Graphics & Multimedia Technology. In year three you will also study an Education Studies minor, where you will gain an understanding of contemporary education issues, teaching and learning.

Students who complete this degree will gain 40 credit points of advanced standing towards the first semester of theMaster of Teaching (Secondary).
