- This program applies to students who commenced in Spring 2019 or later.
- The Graduate Diploma in Vascular Sonography provides graduate entry training in vascular ultrasound imaging. It consists of four theoretical and four practical subjects, with one theoretical and one practical subject per semester for a total of 8 subjects (4 semesters, 2 years). A blended learning model is used to combine a variety of learning and assessment methods. Learning material is presented via an electronic platform, with students also required to attend a face to face, on-campus training seminar each semester. The training seminars start with four days each semester for the first year, reducing to three in semester 3, and then two days in the final semester. These on-campus seminars expose the students to emerging technologies and training along with fundamental knowledge. For the duration of the program the students will complete mandatory clinical training of a minimum of three days per week for the entire program. While there are 384 hours mandated within each semester (total over program 1536), students will be required to continue working outside of the university semesters to meet external accreditation requirements. Upon completion, graduates will have developed the knowledge, skill and professional abilities to practice as vascular sonographers.

- Accreditation
- This program is accredited with the Australian Sonographers Accreditation Registry. Students will be eligible to be registered as a student sonographer, and upon graduating will be eligible to be an accredited vascular sonographer. Graduates may also be eligible for professional membership with the Australian Sonographers Association.
- Work Integrated Learning
- There is a mandatory work component required for completion of this program.  Please contact the Program Advisor listed above for information.
- International students should also refer to the link below for more information and a link to the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS).
- Work Integrated Learning (WIL) for international students
- Clinical training of a minimum of three days in vascular sonography each week (or 24 hours) is required for the duration of the program (as per entry requirements). This is necessary for program accreditation and will be made clear to all program applicants and reaffirmed when students are offered a conditional position in the program. Students are responsible for making these arrangements, which must be confirmed two weeks prior to the start of semester 1 year 1.
- When students are offered a conditional position in the program, they will be sent a clinical practice verification form, which is to be returned as soon as possible, so that measures to verify the suitability of the clinical experience can commence. That is, upon receipt of the signed verification form, the program coordinator will review the form to confirm that the student will have access to appropriate and supervised clinical training.
- Clinical supervisors (at the student’s site) will be provided with numerous means of support. Initially, they will be contacted by the program coordinator to verify their support for the student. They will receive a clinical supervisors guide and instructional video. Information about the content of program subjects and assessment items will be provided at the start of each semester, and prior to practical assessments (at the end of each semester.
- Admission
- Applicants must have successfully completed an undergraduate degree in natural and physical sciences, or health. Applicants with an undergraduate degree in another field will be considered for admission if they can demonstrate greater than 12 months full time work experience in directly related vascular assessment (which must be supported with a statement of service for all work)
- Applicants must secure a minimum of 3 days of work (training) in vascular sonography each week for the duration of the program. Written verification of work (training) must be provided to the university two weeks prior to the commencement of the program.
- Applicants seeking admission on the basis of work experience MUST support their application with a Statement of Service for all work experience listed on the application.
- Applicants seeking admission on the basis of work experience must support their application with a Statement of Service for all work experience listed on the application.
- Statement of Service form
- One additional entry requirement applies for NZ students who are NZ citizens; successful and full completion of an MRTBNZ approved Cultural Competency (Māori) module two weeks prior to commencement of the program.
- MRTBNZ cultural competency (Māori)
- Applicants who have undertaken studies overseas may have to provide proof of proficiency in English. Local and International applicants who are applying through the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC) will find details of minimum English proficiency requirements and acceptable proof on the UAC website. Local applicants applying directly to the University should also use the information provided on the UAC website.
