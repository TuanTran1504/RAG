- The Bachelor of Creative Leadership (BCL) is a unique interdisciplinary degree that equips Western students with the essential skills needed to reshape the present as they prepare for the complex challenges of the future. Students will embark on a journey to grow as creative leaders who are globally aware, interculturally adept, and innovative changemakers. The degree develops the students’ knowledge and skills in leadership and ethics and grows their capacity to lead in complexity by focusing on high-level critical, logical, and systems thinking. Students will develop creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship skills while collaborating in interdisciplinary projects and discussions, to articulate innovative strategies that address complex contemporary and future challenges in both local and international contexts. In the BCL, students will engage with innovative assessments that prepare them for real-world challenges and gain work experience by selecting from a diverse range of opportunities to complete a 60-hour internship. The essential skills learned in the BCL are what the employer of tomorrow will be seeking in a graduate in various roles in the workplace – even if these roles are not yet imagined. The BCL is not a stand-alone degree, but is designed to be undertaken in combination with any Western Sydney bachelor degree.
