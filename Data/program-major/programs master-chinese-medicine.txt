- The Master of Chinese Medicine is a postgraduate qualification designed for Chinese medicine practitioners wishing to strengthen their knowledge and better integrate into the health care system, and for graduates with a Chinese Medicine specialisation seeking a pathway to research. It can be completed in one-and-a-half years of full-time study or the equivalent in part-time study.
- The program includes two major streams: a clinical stream and research-training pathway. The clinical stream features a substantial clinical placement in a teaching hospital in China affiliated with Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (BJUCM) in addition to clinical specialisation workshops. An alternative is also available for students who do not wish to complete the clinical placement overseas. The research stream includes a significant research project which is supported by the National Institute of Complementary Medicine (NICM). Students who wish to enter the research steam have to meet entry requirements (GPA of 5); graduates of this stream may be interested in furthering their studies in a higher degree.
- The program will be delivered via structured, intensive workshops and online resources with self-directed learning between workshops to allow maximum flexibility for busy practitioners.
