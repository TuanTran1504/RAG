- AQF Level:
- This program applies to students who commenced in 2020 up to Autumn 2022.
- Students should follow the program structure for the session start date relevant to the year they commenced.
- For commencement Year 2017 to 2019 - please refer to 3733.1 Bachelor of Medical Science (Forensic Mortuary Practice)
- This is a three-year degree that combines traditional biomedical disciplines (biology, chemistry and biochemistry) with those of medical science (anatomy, physiology, pathology) and with a focus on forensic science in the senior years. Career opportunities include forensic mortuaries and forensic laboratories (as forensic technicians), and also in the funeral industry or as post mortem assistants.
- This program will involve study at both Campbelltown and Hawkesbury campuses.
- Note: This program involves a mandatory health and medical assessment that must be completed prior to enrolling in MEDI 3008 Mortuary Practice, which is offered in Year 3 Autumn, and undertaking the associated clinical placement. Students who are unable to pass the assessment by the end of Autumn session in Year 2 of the program will be required to take a leave of absence pending re-assessment in the following year, or transfer to an alternative medical science or science degree such as 3673 Bachelor of Medical Science (Anatomy and Physiology major) or 3589 Bachelor of Science (Forensic Science).

- There is a mandatory work component required for completion of this program.  Please contact the Program Advisor listed above for information.
- One-day placement (observational) at a forensic mortuary in MEDI 3008 Mortuary Practice.  Two-week clinical placement at a forensic mortuary (or similar) in NATS 3003 Advanced Mortuary Practice.
- NATS 3003 Advanced Mortuary Practice
- Students taking part in the placements do so under the University Student Placement Policy. Ultimately the subject coordinator will have responsibility for ensuring the quality of supervision whilst students are on placement. This will be facilitated by regular contact with the students whilst they are on placement. The course is co-designed and co-delivered by members of FASS and a FASS member (Director) is a member of the EAC. Whilst at FASS the director will have responsibility for ensuring the quality of supervision and liaising with the subject coordinator to ensure a quality outcome. The quality of supervision at non-FASS sites will be the responsibility of the subject coordinator. ‘Good Supervision’ guides are available to help those sites unfamiliar with supervising WSU students.
- Admission
- Assumed knowledge required: At least two of biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics.
- Applicants who have undertaken studies overseas may have to provide proof of proficiency in English. Local and International applicants who are applying through the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC) will find details of minimum English proficiency requirements and acceptable proof on the UAC website. Local applicants applying directly to the University should also use the information provided on the UAC website.
