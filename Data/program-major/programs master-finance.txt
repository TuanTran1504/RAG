The degree provides students with the technical knowledge necessary to function in an evolving and increasingly sophisticated financial environment with an emphasis on the practical application of these techniques. Utilising this technical and practical foundation, students also engage critically with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals through the evaluation of economic, social, and environmental enterprise and professional behaviour and the development of recommendations for sustainable professional or enterprise practice. All of the subjects have been developed by individuals who are actively involved in the financial sector.
