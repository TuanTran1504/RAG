- The Bachelor of Criminal and Community Justice degree is designed for current employees within Corrective Services, as well as students who wish to pursue a career in corrections, probation or parole. The degree will draw upon disciplinary areas such as Criminal Justice, Criminology, Psychology, Social Work and Welfare in order to provide a theoretical framework for those who work with offenders and on issues of rehabilitation, through-care and resettlement. As well as providing a theoretical framework, the program will provide those who complete the degree with the knowledge and skills to develop and evaluate practice with a view to enhancing working with offenders. The Bachelor of Criminal and Community Justice can be described as an ‘applied degree pathway’ insofar as the teaching within the program will link theory to practice. It is important to note that this degree does not guarantee direct employment into Corrections Services.
