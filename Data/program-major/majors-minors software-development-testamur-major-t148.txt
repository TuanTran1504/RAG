- Software Development, Testamur Major (T148)
- Western Sydney University Major Code:
- In this major, students learn how to create high quality software to meet client needs. This involves applying the theories and practices of software development to determine requirements, design and deliver solutions. In this software development lifecycle process, students use a range of technologies, and programming skills used for the development of software systems and distributed applications. In addition, students develop the ability to identify, analyse, and formulate solutions to real-world problems in the software development domain. In devising these solutions students also consider principles associated with user interface design, professional and ethical issues, in particular those relating to security and privacy of user data and user behaviour related to software development and associated applications.
