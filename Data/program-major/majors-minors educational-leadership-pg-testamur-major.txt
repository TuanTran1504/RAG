- This major is designed for teachers and educators seeking to develop the dual capacity to lead teaching and learning as well as lead organisations in an ever-changing business climate. Educational leadership subjects are drawn from the School of Education and the School of Business, providing professionals with comprehensive skills, knowledge and competencies to design original evidence-based investigations and analyse and synthesise a range of data about complex problems to reframe problems and generate solutions. Focusing on theory and practice, the specialisation has significant application to the workplace. Subjects in this specialisation are offered across Autumn/Spring sessions and Quarter sessions, as identified in the subject handbook entries. Please note that the Education Leadership major is fully online therefore onshore international student visa holders are unable to enrol in this major.
