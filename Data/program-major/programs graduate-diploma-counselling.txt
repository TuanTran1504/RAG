- Counselling is a cross-disciplinary pathway into a career in helping human beings in distress. In counselling, clients learn self-knowledge and become able to change through a dedicated helping relationship, in which high levels of skill, sensitivity, self-knowledge and ethical conduct are required of the helper. In contrast to some of the longer-established helping professions, counselling, as taught in this program, places greater emphasis on the creation of a therapeutic environment for the client than on specific techniques or the application of particular theoretical models. This program is aimed specifically at graduates in any discipline who can demonstrate the personal qualities required for this demanding profession.
