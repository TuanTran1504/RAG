- Paramedics play an integral role in the health system, responding to emergencies involving patients with acute and sub-acute health problems in a range of diverse and uncontrolled settings. Paramedics provide unscheduled, out-of-hospital care to patients of all ages, dealing with health complaints that span the spectrum of illness and injury severity and complexity. This contemporary program has a strong evidence-based focus and uses innovative blended learning and assessment strategies, together with diverse clinical placements, to develop high level practical and clinical decision making skills. Completion of the program will enable you to work effectively as a paramedic in an ambulance service, the private paramedical industry, or the defence forces.
- Note: This program involves a mandatory health and medical assessment that must be completed prior to enrolling in HLTH 1009 Paramedic Practice 1 offered in Spring Year 1, and undertaking the associated ambulance service clinical placement. Students who are unable to pass the assessment by the end of Autumn session in the first year of the program will be required to take a leave of absence pending re-assessment in the following year, or transfer to an alternative health science program such as 4656 Bachelor of Health Science.
