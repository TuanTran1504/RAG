- Handbook summary for 2022 - 2023
- The Master of Teaching (Birth – 5 Years / Birth – 12 Years) is a post graduate initial teaching qualification. It provides students with the flexibility of a teaching qualification for early childhood or a combined early childhood and primary teaching qualification. Students can choose to focus on teaching in the prior to school areas with an early exit point of a Master of Teaching (Birth – 5 Years) or they can undertake an additional six months of study to complete a teaching qualification for early childhood and primary school teaching with the Master of Teaching (Birth – 12 Years). This program would be appropriate for people wanting to work as a qualified teacher in preschool and early childhood services and also in a primary school setting.
- From 2022 - The Master of Teaching (Birth-12 Years) incorporates a minimum of 55 days of professional experience in early childhood settings and 30 days professional experience in primary schools (Birth – 12 years).
- From Spring 2023 - The Master of Teaching (Birth-12 Years) incorporates a minimum of 50 days of professional experience in early childhood settings and 30 days professional experience in primary schools (Birth – 12 years).
- Handbook summary from Autumn 2024
- The Master of Teaching (Birth – 5 Years / Birth – 12 Years) is a postgraduate initial teaching qualification that provides students with the flexibility to teach in both early childhood education and care settings and primary schools (Kindergarten to Year 6). This degree focuses on the continuity of children’s learning from birth to 12 years across all curriculum areas, as they transition through educational settings. Students will learn how to foster children's creativity, curiosity, imagination, critical thinking and wellbeing and to engender a love of learning across all curriculum areas. The program focuses on innovative and evidence-based approaches to teaching and learning and development of strong pedagogical content knowledge. It prepares students for their teaching career by emphasising pedagogical approaches and culturally responsive teaching practices that enable diverse learners to access learning experiences, effective classroom management practices, and using assessment and feedback to guide and enhance student learning. Students will explore the significance of the diversity of children’s family and community contexts and gain the knowledge and skills to foster meaningful partnerships. Pedagogical leadership will be developed through 60 days of professional experience in early childhood education and care settings, and 30 days in primary schools.
- Program Logic
- Foundation: Pre-service teachers will develop fundamental knowledge, skills, and attributes to support the beginning of their journey to become a teacher.
- Development: Pre-service teachers will strengthen their pedagogical content knowledge, understanding of classroom management, and evidence-based pedagogical practices.
- Transition: Pre-service teachers will consolidate and apply the knowledge, skills, and attributes required for success as a Graduate Teacher, using evidence to inform and strengthen pedagogical practice.
- Early Exit
- Students may exit this program on completion of 160 credit points with a 1784 Master of Teaching (Birth - 5 Years)
