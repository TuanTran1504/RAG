- This program applies to students who commenced in Term 1, 2014 or later.
- The Diploma in Engineering is designed to engage students in, and further prepare students for, tertiary study in Engineering / Engineering Science and in so doing address any perceived deficiencies in the students’ mathematical and physics knowledge and skills. The Diploma presents students with subjects from the first year of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) or Bachelor of Engineering Science degrees. The Diploma aims to produce students who are fully prepared for study beyond the first year of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) / Engineering Science degrees. The Diploma, completed in a smaller, more supportive learning environment than usually found in first year undergraduate programs, is designed to develop students to have greater ability in self-directed study and have the self-esteem that comes from prior achievement in a tertiary environment.
- Study Mode
- One year full-time. Students will be required to attend the Kingswood or Parramatta South campus for some learning experiences.
