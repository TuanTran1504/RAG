- The minor, Economics for Secondary Teaching, provides a broad pluralist perspective on fundamental aspects of relationships between individuals, firms, institutions and countries. Students in the minor learn how economies function and how public policy and the way organisations behave affect diverse social, economic and environmental problems. Students are introduced to a wide array of competing economic theories, so that they are critically informed about the ways in which they can transform the world. Students who study economics can expect to develop their analytical and problem solving skills and to be intellectually challenged. The field of study is designed to meet NESA content requirements for teaching Economics in NSW High Schools.
