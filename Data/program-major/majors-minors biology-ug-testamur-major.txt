- Biology, Testamur Major (T053)
- Western Sydney University Major Code:
- Previous Code: MT3042
- This major is available as an elective in Bachelor of Science 3754 , and an elective major option in Bachelor of Medical Science 3755. See the related programs tab for more information.
- Please note, the BSc Major Environmental Health T076, BSc Adv 3757, Bachelor of Science (Pathway to Teaching Primary/Secondary) 3756 & BMedSc Adv 3758, do not have sufficient Flexible space to accommodate a second/elective Major.
- This major applies to students who commenced in Spring 2022 or later.
- For Commencement Year 2021 to Autumn 2022 - Please refer to MT3042 Biology
- For Commencement Year 2020 - Please refer to MT3016 Biology
- Students should follow the major structure for the session start date relevant to the year they commenced.
- Biology is underpinned by cells, the fundamental units necessary for organisms to grow, reproduce and interact with each other and the environment. Cells are also the basis of emerging computer models and bio-technology innovations. Biologists integrate principles from many disciplines, including chemistry, bio-physics, genetics, biochemistry, physiology and bioinformatics, for a more complete understanding of animal, plant and microbial cell function. Understanding these processes and the principles that govern the organization and function of cells are a necessary framework for creating the next advances in developmental biology and disease mitigation. At WSU, the strong emphasis on hands-on experience gives biology graduates an excellent foundation for careers in: teaching, academia, research, biotechnology, industry, law and administration. The flexibility of the major also enables students to combine their interest with other disciplines including ecology, environment, zoology and agriculture and environmental health..
