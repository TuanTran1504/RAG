6. Copyright Licences

WSUIC is licensed as an Educational Institution in accordance Part VB, (Reproducing and Communicating Works etc. by Educational and other Institutions) of the Copyright Act, to reproduce certain amounts of works for:

use in connection with courses of study conducted vy WSUIC; and
administrative purposes


WSU has a licence agreement with Copyright Agency Limited (CAL) for text and images including the Hardcopy licence and the Electronic Reproduction and Communication licence which allows the use of text and images from any source or format:

digital or hardcopy;
online or offline;
Australian or foreign content;
published or unpublished content; and includes:
copying hardcopy to digital;
photocopying of hardcopy to hardcopy;
copying digital to digital; and
communication of copies in a digital form.


Note: Copyright also applies to all information on the internet.
Print copies may be made for students, subject to the following restrictions:

from a book – up to 10% or one chapter of the book, whichever is greater;
from a journal or magazines (including newspapers) – up to one complete article from any one issue of the journal or periodical (If there are two or more articles on the same topic in the journal, then these may be copies, but the same topic restriction should be interpreted narrowly);
from an anthology: works contained in the anthology which are less than 15 pages in length;
no more than 10% of the words or pages of a website;
separately published works made available through a website, such as reports, are treated as individual works and subject to the chapter of 10% rule.


The limits referred to above should be applied per course. That is, regardless of how many members of the teaching staff are teaching a course in a given semester, no more than 10 percent of a work should be copied or electronically transmitted to students by those members of the teaching staff (when their copying is aggregated).

For CAL licences, there is no limit to the number of copies made and copies can be sold to recoup costs but not for a profit.


WSU also has a licence agreement with Screenrights which allows for the reproduction of recording and/or communicating audio visual materials sourced from a broadcast. This licence agreement does NOT include:

purchase, rented or borrowed DVD’s or videos; and/or
digital download or podcasts (unless they are from a free-to-air- broadcast)


Screenrights licences apply from 29 January 1990, and copies from radio and TV before then are not covered under the licence. Such items may be kept in the library, loaned and played in class but not copied.



7. Responsibility

Everyone must comply with copyright law.
Everyone is responsible for ensuring that copying for the purposes of research, study, criticism, review, parody or satire is fair and is limited to the amounts indicated in the Copyright Act;
Everyone is responsible for ensuring that content containing third party copyright content, especially that held under commercial Music Licence is not stored on external non- WSU/WSUIC digital platforms and services such as social media, unless the content is original, covered by a Creative Commons Licence, and/or has no known copyright restrictions;
Everyone is responsible for acting on WSU/WSUIC’s advice to minimise the risk of copyright infringement.
Teaching staff must familiarise themselves with current copyright laws and the limits on copying under licence. There are a number of online resources available including:

Australian Government Attorney-General’s Department

Screenrights


Professional and Teaching Staff are personally and legally liable if they infringe copyright or sanction a student to do so.
It is the responsibility of the staff member to seek clarification if unsure of the copyright requirements.
When giving private tuition that is not connected with WSUIC, staff are not covered by licences purchased by WSU.
Authors/designers of works have automatic copyright, however, where works are made during the course of employment the copyrights are owned by the employer (unless varied by agreement). Anyone who wishes to use the material must:

credit the material to its author/designer to with appropriate referencing to avoid plagiarism;
not take it out of context or modify it without acknowledging the source; and
comply with the requirements of the CAL agreement.

Copyright Regulations 1969
WARNING
Copyright owners are entitled to take legal action against persons who infringe their copyright. A reproduction of material that is protected by copyright may be a copyright infringement. Certain dealings with copyright will not constitute an infringement, including:

A reproduction that is a fair dealing under the Copyright Act 1968 (the Act), including a fair dealing for the purposes of research or study; or
A reproduction that is authorised by the copyright owner.

It is a fair dealing to make a reproduction for the purposes of research or study, of one or more articles on the same subject in a periodical publication, or, in the case of any other work, of a reasonable portion of a work.
In the case of a published work in hardcopy form that is not less than ten pages and is not an artistic work, ten per cent of the number of pages, or one chapter, is a reasonable portion.
In the case of a published work in electronic form only, a reasonable portion is not more than, in the aggregate, ten per cent of the number of words in the work.
More extensive reproduction may constitute fair dealing. To determine whether it does, it is necessary to have regard to the criteria set out in subsection 40 (2) of the Act.
A court may impose penalties and award damages in relation to offences and infringements relating to copyright material.
Higher penalties may apply, and higher damages may be awarded, for offences and infringements involving the conversion of material into digital or electronic form.
Please see Quality and Compliance if you have any questions.
