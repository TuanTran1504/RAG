Student Visa Overview Student Visa Overview
Simplified Student Visa Framework
On 16 June 2015 the Australian Government released the Future directions for streamlined visa processing report and announced the introduction of a simplified student visa framework (SSVF) to support Australia’s education services sector.
Under the SSVF, all registered education providers have been allocated an immigration risk rating based on the immigration risk outcomes of their international students over a 12-month period. The same approach has also been used to allocate an immigration risk rating to each country/region. The single immigration risk framework will be used to guide the evidence of financial capacity and English language proficiency that a student is required to provide with their visa application. It will be based on two factors – the immigration risk outcomes associated with the student’s education provider and country/region of citizenship.

Genuine Student and Genuine Temporary Student Requirement and Access to Funds
To be eligible for streamlined visa processing and to apply to Western Sydney University International College you must be a genuine student and fulfil the genuine temporary entrant requirement and have sufficient funds to:

cover your tuition fees
cover your living expense and travel costs for the duration of your stay in Australia
secure overseas student health cover (OSHC) for the duration of your study in Australia
cover student services amenities fees

The Student Visa Application Process
Students often apply for a student visa with the assistance from one of our agent representatives.
On receipt of your Acceptance to Study at Western Sydney University International College (WSUIC) and fee payment, WSUIC will create an electronic Confirmation of Enrolment (eCoE) which is recorded with DoHA for student visa application purposes. A copy of the eCoE will be sent to you or your agent to include with your Australian student visa application.
If you hold a current student visa, Western Sydney University International College will send you your eCoE upon receipt of your course acceptance. You must apply for a new student visa prior to the expiry of your current visa.
Bringing Family
If you wish to bring children and/or your spouse (dependents) for the duration of your study in Australia, please refer to information on bringing family on DoHA’s website.
You will also need to consider financial requirements to cover any family members travelling with you:

health cover
school costs for any school-aged dependents
living expenses

Visa Conditions
If you are in Australia on a student visa, you must maintain your attendance and satisfactory academic progress at all times. WSUIC is obliged to advise Department of Home Affairs when an International Student Visa holder is not maintaining satisfactory attendance/academic progress. This may result in an automatic visa cancellation.
Please also be aware of consequences if you no longer have access to sufficient funds to cover your study in Australia.
Student visas automatically grant students permission to do paid work while studying (up to 40 hours per fortnight while your course is in session and unlimited hours during scheduled course breaks).
Provide your Australian address, phone and email address to WSUIC as soon as possible. If you change these at any time, you must inform WSUIC immediately.
Further information about student visa conditions for you and any family members travelling with you can be found on DoHA’s visa conditions page.
