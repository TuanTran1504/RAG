Working in Australia Working in Australia
As an international student you may work up to 40 hours a fortnight during each study session and unlimited hours when your course is not in session. Permission to work is automatically included in your student visa although work can only be commenced once classes start. Although you are able to work in Australia, you cannot rely on that income to fund your tuition fees or living costs for the duration of your stay in Australia. Many international students choose to work part-time during their studies, but it is unrealistic to expect that you will find part-time work as soon as you begin looking for it.
Western Sydney University offers all international students assistance and advice on a range of career-related matters, including how to create a resume, job applications and selection criteria.
