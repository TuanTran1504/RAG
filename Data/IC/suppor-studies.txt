We’re here to support you, all the way.
We purposely keep our class sizes small so your voice can be heard and your needs met. With approximately 25 students in each class, our teachers are able to give the best possible support and attention to each individual student.
But it’s not only your academic needs we’ll focus on. We pride ourselves on the support we offer to make your time at the International College as stress-free as possible. Access a range of support services and facilities – from study assistance to counselling and advice – to help make your transition a successful one.
