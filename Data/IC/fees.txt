Sydney is a popular city to live in. As a student visa holder, you will be required to have approximately AU$29,710 per person per year for living expenses, as advised by the Australian Government. However, the actual cost depends on your individual lifestyle and you should budget for up to AU$30,300 per year per adult.
Remember, your living expenses are separate from your tuition fees. You will need to bring enough money with you to cover your expenses for the first few weeks. International transfers can take some time! Foreign currency can be exchanged for Australian currency at Sydney Airport. If you arrive on Saturday or Sunday, it is best to exchange your currency at the airport as currency exchange offices outside the airport may be closed until Monday.
