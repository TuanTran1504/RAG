Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) is insurance that provides cover for medical and hospital care which you may need while you are in Australia.
If you are an international student studying in Australia and have a student visa, you must purchase an approved OSHC policy from a registered health insurance company. You will need to buy OSHC before you come to Australia, to cover you from the day you arrive. It is a student visa condition that all students maintain OSHC throughout their stay in Australia.
