Students at Western Sydney University International College can utilise on-campus accommodation at a number of University campuses, including Parramatta, Penrith and Bankstown.
With a range of activities, sporting facilities, indoor and outdoor entertainment, living on campus at Western Sydney University is a great opportunity to meet a range of people from different cultures, make new friends and sink in to the next phase of your life. We acknowledge the Traditional Owners, Custodians and Elders past and present of the Indigenous Nations of the Darug, Gundungurra, Dâ€™harawal, Wiradjuri and Bundjalung on whose lands we work.
