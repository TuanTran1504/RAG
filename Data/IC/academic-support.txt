Western Sydney University International College offers English and Mathematics support classes each term, commencing in week 3.
English support classes provide students with personalised support in areas such as writing, structuring an essay, developing paragraphs, academic referencing, academic research, grammar and tertiary study skills.
The mathematics support classes assist students with statistics and problem-solving techniques. These 1-2-hour support classes are held at least four times a week at different times to ensure all students have a chance to access them. The classes are taught by English language, Mathematics and Statistics specialist teachers.
You can also attend regular workshops designed to improve overall academic performance. With classes on essay writing, referencing, skim-reading, literacy skills and more, a few workshops could be the difference between a credit and a high-distinction.
Please speak with your teacher to enrol in these classes.
