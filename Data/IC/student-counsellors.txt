If you are experiencing challenging academic and personal situations, we can help ease the pressure by speaking with a highly-trained counsellor.
A Counsellor is a professional equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to provide guidance on personal or psychological problems. The university’s Counselling Service comprises a team of friendly male and female staff, who are qualified social workers, psychologists or mental health specialists, trained and experienced to work with a diverse student population on any issues of concern. The Counsellors are employed by the university and are situated within the Student Services office on every campus.
Counselling is available Monday to Friday from 9:00am to 5:00pm. We’re open all year, including session breaks. We’re closed on public holidays and when the University is closed at the end of the year.  To make an appointment, please email counselling@westernsydney.edu.au or call 1300 688 370.
