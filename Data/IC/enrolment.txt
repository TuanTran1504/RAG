This page is designed to guide you through the simple and seamless enrolment process. Our goal is to make sure you’re fully prepared to dive into university studies and excel from day one.
Once you are enrolled in a course and in the units that you wish to complete during the term, you can generate an individual timetable that will be saved and you can access anytime via the Student Portal.
