Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Respect.Now.Always
We proudly commit to the national Respect.Now.Always.
Western Sydney University International College is committed to cultivating a respectful, diverse, equitable and inclusive community. We believe everyone in our community has the right to a safe, secure and comfortable learning and work environment. We do not tolerate sexual harassment or assault.
As part of our commitment to the safety of our community, we are creating a space for staff and students to have conversations without fear of humiliation or victimisation. These conversations will be kept in confidence due to their personal and sensitive nature. More information about this can also be found here.
Western Sydney University has an anonymous reporting mechanism available to International College students and staff, in addition to the support that is available at the College.
If you are aware of or have experienced an incident of sexual assault or harassment, see something that shouldn’t be happening, or feel unsafe, please report it. You can make an anonymous report if you choose to do so here. All reports are treated seriously and confidentially.
