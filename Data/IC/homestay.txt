Homestay Homestays
Homestays involve a single or shared room at the home of an Australian family, and is a great opportunity for you to immerse yourself in the English language and Australian culture, either for the duration of your study, or while you find your own accommodation. Live With an Australian Family
If you are keen to experience the Australian culture, or secure short-term accommodation until you find a suitable place to stay, living with a local family can be a great choice. For all students under the age of 18, it is a legal requirement to stay with an Australian host family until you turn 18 years of age.
Homestay can help you settle in to your new life quickly, providing the opportunity to participate in the daily routine of an Australian family and practice your English language skills. To find out more, please contact the providers below for more information and booking details.
