Confirmation From the International College Receive Confirmation from Western Sydney University International College
On receipt of your signed Acceptance form and fees, your place at Western Sydney University International College will be confirmed. Most offers issued by the International College are packaged with an offer from Western Sydney University, hence the International College will issue the eCoEs (Electronic Confirmation of Enrolments) as required. The eCoEs are the key document required for your visa application.
NOTE: Under 18 students must have a care giver/guardian in place before the eCoEs can be issued for visa purposes. Australian law regards students under the age of 18 as minors and as such, there is a special visa requirement regarding their welfare. Students under the age of 18 must be placed in the care of a guardian while studying in Australia. Parents can nominate a guardian or arrangements can be made with Guardianship Services recommended by the International College.
