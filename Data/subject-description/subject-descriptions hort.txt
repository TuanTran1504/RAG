This means our modern, urban-oriented society must begin to reconnect with the sources of our food to create more sustainable future. This subject explores the scientific basis of sustainable crop production by examining fruit, vegetable and grain enterprises. Management of produce from harvest to consumption will also be explored to examine factors that impact upon food quality and safety. Students will compare and contrast growing conditions of the highly variable Australian environment to consider the global context for horticultural industry development. By delving into the world of crop management, students will identify the impacts (opportunities and constraints) of plant physiology on the sustainability of food. Students will also consider how novel food products can prompt consumers to appreciate the environmental, economic and social benefits that can arise from sustainable horticultural production.Level: Undergraduate Level 1 subject  Equivalent Subjects: HORT 1003  - Horticultural Production 2 LGYA 5944 -  Fruit Production HORT 1002 -  Crop Production HORT 1001 -  Crop Production  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject HORT 1006  Protected Cropping Biosecurity and Pollination  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 301214  The protected cropping industry in Australia is a rapidly expanding sector.

Also called 'greenhouse horticulture', these advanced systems integrate technologies across disciplines (e.g. horticultural, environmental and material sciences; mechanical engineering and design; robotics and computing programming) to create futuristic indoor environments that increase the quantity and quality of plant-derived foods. Controlled environments can significantly reduce reliance on inputs (fertiliser, pesticide, energy and water) and reduce environmental impacts (including 'food miles'). This subject explores a range of greenhouse technologies in Australia and overseas-from simple low-cost options, through to cutting-edge technology in energy and water-efficient production. Students will observe current status and future trends in the industry to examine how advanced technologies can improve sustainability measures along with the reliability of horticultural output. Students will consider how innovative horticultural enterprises can provide consumers with greater capacity to adopt more sustainable diets.Level: Undergraduate Level 2 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject HORT 2003  Plant Production  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 301447  This subject will provide you with an understanding of the scientific basis of sustainable plant production in natural and built environments.
