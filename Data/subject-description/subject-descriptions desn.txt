Academic Handbook Current Edition Graphic and Design (DESN) DESN 0001  Design Practice (WSTC Prep)  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 700223  Design Practice introduces students to the fundamental principles of graphic design practice. This subject investigates how the design process is applied to real-world industry design briefs to create a visual design. Students develop an understanding of the processes and practices used to support collaboration between clients, designers and specialists when designing and producing visual communications. Students are guided through the process of interpreting a design brief, creating and pitching a design response, presenting work for critique, incorporating critique into a design solution and producing highly refined design outcomes to a professional standard.  Students work on a number of design briefs using industry standard work practices, including time management strategies, multi-tasking, strict delivery deadlines, brief comprehension and job documentation as well as client/designer coordination and negotiation.Level: Undergraduate Level 0 Preparatory subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject DESN 0002  The Design Process (WSTC Prep)  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 700197  The Design Process introduces the elements and principles of design as well as design processes and methods required to explore and creatively apply the design process. The Design Process focuses on the skills and concepts that contribute to interpreting and responding to design briefs, as well as researching, developing and presenting innovative design solutions. The core of any design process is the design brief. The Design Process acknowledges the importance of this and how it informs relationships between the client, designer and specialists engaged to develop the design process. The subject addresses the purpose, sequence, major stages and application of the design process to synthesise solutions relevant to the design industry.Level: Undergraduate Level 0 Preparatory subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject DESN 0003  Critical Thought in Design (WSTC Prep)  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 700321  Critical Thought in Design provides students with an understanding of the process designers use to structure their thinking and communicate ideas with clients, target audiences, other designers and specialists.
