Some of these problems are so complex that they can be called 'wicked' problems, or problems that are highly resistant to resolution. This subject uses project-based learning to provide students with the opportunity to work collaboratively and inter-disciplinarily to solve an industry-driven 'wicked' problem, using systematic and evidence-based techniques to do so. Students will be challenged to think broadly to take into account the interrelationships among a full range of causal factors underlying the 'wicked' problem at hand, and will be required to use more collaborative and innovative approaches to solve industry challenges. Students will be exposed to a range of industry representatives who will pose the difficult, 'wicked' problems to them and who will return to assess the proposed solutions.Level: Postgraduate Coursework Level 7 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject HLTH 7028  Professional Project in Health 2  (20 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 401370  This capstone subject intends to develop students' work-readiness. Health professionals are recurrently asked to engage in reflective practice as a way to improve clinical and non-clinical reasoning. The ability to reflect on action and in action allows health professionals not only to improve their practice but also to more clearly articulate their strengths and weaknesses to potential employers. In this subject, students will focus on creating an portfolio that will require revisiting all content learned throughout their courses to critically assess their learning journey and learning outcomes. It will teach students how to systematically self-reflect in deep and transformative ways, engaging with theory and knowledge acquired and developed through their studies to design and create a portfolio of their skills and competencies through a social capital framework.Level: Postgraduate Coursework Level 7 subject  Incompatible Subjects: HLTH 7026 Professional Internship in Health  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject HLTH 7029  Quality and Safety  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 401371  This subject provides an overview of emerging health policy with particular attention to quality and safety.
