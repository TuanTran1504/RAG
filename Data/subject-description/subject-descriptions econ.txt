The subject will be based on the analytical narratives of macroeconomic developments taught in Australian Macroeconomy.  Starting from the basic IS-LM model, it derives the aggregate demand (AD) curve and examines the components of commodity and money markets.  It also analyses the labour market and derives the aggregate supply (AS) curve of an economy.  Using the AD-AS model, it examines the interdependent nature of macroeconomic problems (e.g. inflation, unemployment), and the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies within a closed economy context.  The basic model is then extended to analyse open economy issues (e.g., exchange rates and balance of payments, external shocks and international interdependence). Whenever appropriate, alternative approaches to macroeconomics are evaluated.Level: Undergraduate Level 2 subject  Pre-requisite(s): ECON 1013  Equivalent Subjects: LGYA 4311 - Macroeconomic Analysis  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject ECON 3001  Applied Econometrics  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 200054  This subject builds on the econometric methods of Economic Modelling.
