In exploring environmental philosophy the subject provides students with an understanding of the nature and emergence of both modern and post-modern paradigms that influence the direction and nature of current development policy.  The nature of environmental policy is examined by developing an understanding of how values and attitudes shape a governing ethic about environmental management. The social, political, economic and ecological elements of sustainable development are unfolded to aid students understanding of what needs to be managed.  Particular attention is given to those issues confronting developing countries as they move to become industrialised nations yet have high levels of poverty.  Finally, the subject introduces the practice of environmental impact assessment as one management tool used in the management process.Level: Postgraduate Coursework Level 7 subject  Equivalent Subjects: LGYB 8266 - Environmental Management Core Studies 1 LGYB 8275 - Environmental Management  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject AGEN 7005  Research Protocol Design and Practice  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 401080  In this subject postgraduate students develop a proposal for a research study in an area of interest, drawing upon their knowledge and experiences from other subjects in their program of study.
