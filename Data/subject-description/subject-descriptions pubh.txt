Air pollution does not recognise socio-political boundaries, and air pollutants transfer intercontinentally through pathways both close to the Earth's surface and upper atmosphere. Air Quality management represents a major challenge facing humanity because it poses a threat to human health, agriculture and environmental sustainability, as it can penetrate even remote and once pristine environments. As such, air pollution management and control is of International, National, State and Local government and community concern. This subject critically analyses the natural and anthropogenic sources of air pollution, their nature, health and environmental impacts, monitoring, regulation and control.Level: Undergraduate Level 3 subject  Incompatible Subjects: PUBH 3002  Air Quality and Climate Change  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject PUBH 3022  Advances and Challenges in Health Promotion  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 401380  This subject presents current advances and challenges in health promotion.

Uncertainty, abandonment and lack of organisational willingness to adopt, and failure to manage the realisation of business benefits from health information technology investments lead digital technology projects to fail. This subject provides an overview of capability required to enable health organisations to measure and optimise the value of digital health initiatives. Students will be introduced to various concepts and frameworks used to measure and quantify the benefits of digital health in Australia and elsewhere. Students will have opportunities to participate in industry case studies and analysis.Level: Postgraduate Coursework Level 7 subject  Co-requisite(s): For students enrolled in 4778 Graduate Diploma in Digital Health and 4698 Master of Health Science 2-year and 15-year pathwaysPUBH 7031  Health Systems and PolicyNote Students in the 1 year pathway will need to complete a rule waiver form to enrol in this unit  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject PUBH 7030  Health Systems Planning and Evaluation  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 401364  This subject addresses health services planning and evaluation, as well as health economics. This subject aims to provide students with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand and apply the major concepts involved in health services planning and evaluation.

This subject explores concepts that form the basis for the way health systems are designed and operate. This subject will equip students with the skills to critique challenges and opportunities that can influence how health services are delivered and resourced such as health workforce shortages, digital health innovations, public-private partnerships, and changing demographics. This subject will also examine the crucial role of governance and health policy in determining funding priorities and shaping health systems with a particular focus on the Australian health system, but within an international context. These issues are critiqued with health reform and the drivers for change nationally and internationally.Level: Postgraduate Coursework Level 7 subject  Equivalent Subjects: PUBH 7022 Public Health Policy and Society  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject PUBH 7032  Patient-centred digital healthcare  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 401367  Patient-Centred Digital Healthcare introduces students to consumer engagement and consumer informatics approaches and many other examples of innovations using data analytics and digital health strategies in clinical, community-based, and home-based settings. Students will learn about the role of Patient-facing Technologies to empower patients and improve safety and the importance of standardisation of the electronic management of healthcare information and the automation of clinical processes in delivering patient-centred care. Central to fulfilling this role is ensuring that care is delivered in a safe and effective manner.

Such factors determine access to and use of resources influencing health outcomes and resulting in disparities in health or health inequalities. In this unit, students will use theories and frameworks for the social determinants of health to assess the role of key social factors in affecting the health and illness of individuals and communities. Students will be introduced to the challenges of measuring and addressing the social determinants of health, and critically examine examples of programmatic and policy interventions aimed at reducing health inequalities and addressing the social determinants of health.Level: Postgraduate Coursework Level 7 subject  Equivalent Subjects: HLTH 7001  A Global Perspective on the Social Determinants of Health  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject PUBH 7034  Workplace Safety and Risk Management  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 401373  This subject provides a critical insight into the theory and practice of managing health and safety in the workplace. Students have the opportunity to develop a safety systems approach, concentrating on hazard identification, risk assessment and devising control measures incorporating safety management principles to address current and emerging workplace health and safety issues. Students will learn the importance of developing a safety culture in the workplace as a core principle of safe work system management. In addition, the subject addresses the legal underpinning of health and safety requirements at the workplace.
