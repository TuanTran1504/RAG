The subject claims to engage students with current global contexts to integrate professional knowledge and develop skills, attitudes and behaviours that support them to be global citizens with inter-cultural competence. As part of the subject students will be required to undertake an global learning experience relevant to their studies. This experience may involve travel to an overseas organisation and/or community, or participation with a local or online globally focused organisation. The subject is completed across a year of study, with the first semester a preparatory experience, mid-semester the opportunity to complete an global short program, and the final semester a time to reflect. Students will immerse themselves in their new global environment, make sense of the organisation's or a community's modes of action and meaning, and negotiate their ways of acting and being in the process of becoming a member and contributing to the organisation and/or community with which they engage. Students in this subject will reflect on global engagement experiences to discuss self-learning and how this learning informs personal and professional development.Level: Undergraduate Level 3 subject  Pre-requisite(s): Students must have completed 120cp in their currently enrolled course prior to enrolling in this unit  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject CULT 3024  Crime, Media, Culture  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 102710  There is a close relationship between representations of crime in mass and social media, and policy and legal responses to crime. Media consumers are producing and circulating content about crime and criminality through new media technologies, and some are using social media and the internet to engage in new forms of criminality. In this subject, we explore the complex role of mass media and 'new' media in debates over crime and crime control, and the facilitation of criminality by media technologies. This means studying contemporary media theory and its relevance for criminology, and the effects of social media and computing technology on representations and practices of criminality. The subject maintains a strong focus on the ways in which media and culture informs crime policy and criminal justice processes.Level: Undergraduate Level 3 subject  Equivalent Subjects: CULT 3010 - Culture and Crime  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject CULT 3025  Prisons, Punishment and Criminal Justice  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 102711  The demise of corporal punishment and the rise of incarceration are defining features of control in modern states. This subject provides an historical and sociological examination of the models, practices and justifications for punishment and incarceration. It begins with an overview of early liberal notions of the social contract, the modern movement away from corporal punishment towards incarceration, and a subsequent welfare oriented emphasis on treatment, reform and rehabilitation. Following from this, the subject explores the development of probation and parole systems, decarceration, community corrections, mass imprisonment, and the contemporary control of risk and 'dangerous' populations. These themes are considered through an intersectional analysis of structural factors such as age, gender, sexuality, social class, racial/ethnic identity and the impact of imprisonment and corrections on different individuals and groups. This subject pays particular attention to the over-representation of Indigenous populations in Australian prisons.Level: Undergraduate Level 3 subject  Incompatible Subjects: CULT 2011 - Prisons Punishment and Criminal Justice (Level 2)  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject CULT 5001  Organised Crime and Criminal Organisations  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Organised crime generates serious individual and collective social harm, and poses threat to both national, regional and international security. It challenges states, exploits individuals, pursues profit, wrecks economies, destroys civil society, and ultimately weakens democracy. 

This subject explores the emergence and growth of various types of organised crime and criminal organisations over the world from critical and inter-disciplinary perspectives. It also equips students with critical understanding of the nature and operation of various organised crime and criminal organisations, as well as their growing portfolio of illicit activities across borders and its impact on national and global security. While considering the security threat organised crime and criminal organisations pose at national and global level, this subject aims at nurturing students ability to develop a wholistic, humanistic, and just policies to prevent and control organised crime - not just stepping up policing and securities measures.
