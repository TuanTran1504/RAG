How we choose and use this research is critical, as is the way that we understand ourselves to be a researcher, beyond our practitioner identity. If you are seeking to translate benchtop research (basic laboratory approaches) into applied research practice, and if you are transitioning towards a new identity as a clinician-researcher, this is the subject for you. Our applied research focus considers broad applications relevant to the creative arts therapies, verbal therapies, allied and other health professions, by looking at research processes which ultimately improve practice in the 'real world'.Level: Postgraduate Coursework Level 7 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject REHA 9001  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Art Therapy  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800125  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject REHA 9002  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Chiropractic and Osteopathy  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800101  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject REHA 9003  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Occupational Therapy  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800127  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject REHA 9004  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Physiotherapy  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800099  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject REHA 9005  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Podiatry  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800103  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject REHA 9006  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Rehabilitation Therapies  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800097  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject
