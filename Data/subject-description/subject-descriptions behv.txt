This subject will explore the theories, techniques and effectiveness of new and emerging psychological therapies; prepare students for working in multidisciplinary teams; and introduce students to the practice of clinical psychology with more complex client groups. The subject will also examine the professional and organisational roles of clinical psychologists within these settings.

Please note: some of the activities in this subject may include experiential learning, for example where students may be asked to take on the client role using their own lived experience, to provide opportunity for training in therapeutic modalities that are more “real-world”. Students may opt-out of these activities without consequence through speaking to the subject coordinator and alternative arrangements for student learning opportunities will be organised.Level: Postgraduate Coursework Level 7 subject  Pre-requisite(s): BEHV 7027 ANDBEHV 7029  Equivalent Subjects: BEHV 7028  - Psychological Interventions 2 LGYA 1563  - Psychological Interventions 3  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject BEHV 9001  Higher Degree Research Thesis - The MARCS Institute  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800155  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject BEHV 9002  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Writing and Society Research Centre  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800156  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject BEHV 9003  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Clinical Psychology  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800187  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject BEHV 9004  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Psychology  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800027  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject BEHV 9005  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Psychology  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800188  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject BEHV 9006  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Psychology  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800208  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject
