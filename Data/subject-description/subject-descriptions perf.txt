Academic Handbook Current Edition Performing Arts (PERF) PERF 1010  Music Performance 1  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 102553  In this subject, students will develop their performance skills through participating in three modularised workshops. The first two workshops will run in parallel with each other and will be rotated: module 1 will focus on improvisation; and module 2 will focus on (western or non-western) music from an oral tradition. Module 3 will then extend students' skills in reading and arranging music, utilising their preferred performing media (voice or instrument). In this third module, they will perform set technical tasks (such as scales and arpeggios) and, in groups, they will arrange and perform one set piece of music from a basic notated score, and they will choose, arrange and perform another piece. They will perform one piece chosen from modules 1, 2, or 3 in a public venue on campus. The subject will also introduce basic music business skills, such as how to advertise and mount a public performance.Level: Undergraduate Level 1 subject  Equivalent Subjects: PERF 1008 - Introduction to Music Performance  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject PERF 1012  Music Performance 2  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 102554  Students will extend their performance skills acquired in Music Performance 1 through participating in three modularised workshops. The first two workshops will run in parallel with each other and will be rotated: module 1 will focus on free and notated improvisation; and module 2 will focus on choral performance. Module 3 will extend the skills of reading and arranging music in students' preferred performing media (voice or instrument). In this module, they will perform set technical tasks (such as scales and arpeggios), adding to the skills acquired in Music Performance 1 and, continuing to work in small groups, they will arrange and perform one set piece of music from a basic notated score, and choose, arrange and perform another piece that is different from the music performed in Music Performance 1. They will perform one piece chosen from modules 1, 2, or 3 in a public venue on campus. The subject will also introduce music business skills, such as how to publicise and mount a performance, and how to upload a sample of work to YouTube.Level: Undergraduate Level 1 subject  Pre-requisite(s): PERF 1008 ORPERF 1010  Equivalent Subjects: PERF 1013 - Music Performance 2 Notated and Free Musics PERF 1007 - Free and Notated Music Performance  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject PERF 1014  Music Production  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 102558  This subject presents an overview of the basic concepts and applications of electronic and digital music production technology in current music and media arts practice.

The second area of study is the development of a suite of onstage skills and strategies including physical gesture, audience communication and facility with musical equipment.Level: Undergraduate Level 2 subject  Pre-requisite(s): PERF 1007 ORPERF 1008 ORPERF 1012 ORPERF 1010  Equivalent Subjects: LGYA 1098 - Music Performance 3 Australian Repertoire PERF 2003 - Collaboration and Live Music Performance  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject PERF 2017  Music and Wellbeing  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 102248  This subject looks at the psychosocial importance of music to our wellbeing throughout our lives and during each day. Delivered in a lectorial format (lecture with practical activities throughout), the subject explores the relationship between music and the body, mind, emotions, mood, memory, communication and creativity from experimental studies through to practice-based evidence. This subject is not necessarily about performing music, although some music making will take place. Rather, it is focused on how music can improve our wellbeing throughout our lives. The ideas and approaches discussed are important across the humanities, the social sciences and the health sciences, as well as to musicians who are looking to use their music in the therapeutic context.Level: Undergraduate Level 2 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject PERF 2023  The Composer-Performer  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 101539  Students are required to both perform and compose in this subject.

It explores the cultural-political ways in which the West represents world music as a commodity and considers how the music is inflected with notions of identity, modernity, globalisation, displacement and migration. It charts the ways in which, as a social practice, world music engages politics to promote change, giving voice to marginalised groups. Students will have the opportunity to perform selected rhythms from different cultures.

Students will learn to critique various methods, considering their strengths, weaknesses and appropriateness to a self-devised research project. Delivered in a workshop format, each week students will consider a method or aspect thereof and develop skills in pursuing these towards their research outcome. Methods canvassed in the subject include practice-led research, where creative practice can be both the starting point and the research outcome; primary research (where the researcher gathers information from interviews, surveys and so on), music science (cognition and computation); ethics in research; identifying appropriate fields of research; and quantitative and qualitative methods.Level: Undergraduate Level 3 subject  Equivalent Subjects: PERF 3017 - Music in Theory and Practice  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject PERF 3013  Music and Analysis  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 101152  Analysis enables students to acquire a deep and rich understanding of music. This subject will focus on the formal designs, rhythmic, melodic and harmonic structures of notated music, and the structures, contexts and processes of non-notated music. It will include notated and recorded music from the popular song traditions, as well as studio recordings, electronic music and improvisation. It will consider the strengths, weaknesses and cultural biases of various modes of analysis, including the use of musical notation.

It asks how we encounter and experience music, and what makes a piece of music aesthetically pleasing and who decides. It asks whether the meanings attributed to music are as much intrinsic as they are cultural. The subject considers emotions and feelings in music, and why we would listen to music if it makes us feel sad. When music is used as an instrument of torture is it still music? How do we view the composer in the musical work? Where does creativity reside in a musical work? Is there a difference between musical thinking and thinking about music? Is music representational or immanent or both? Is music political? The subject provides an historical overview of the important debates and considers the poststructuralist critique of these debates. Students will design a question chosen from the topics covered in the subject, and retrieve and critically evaluate the appropriate literature for their project.Level: Undergraduate Level 3 subject  Equivalent Subjects: PERF 3015 - Music and Meaning PERF 3016 - Music and Philosophy  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject PERF 3022  Screen Media Composition  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 102563  This subject is the final stage in the Composition and Music Production sub-major sequences.
