It includes theoretical perspectives on the brain and learning including memory formation, retention and models of motivation, attention, and knowledge acquisition. This subject dispels common educational neuromyths and focuses on evidence-informed pedagogical practices that support learning, engagement, motivation, and wellbeing in culturally responsive classrooms.

This subject aims to develop students personal literacy and numeracy skills necessary for participating in academic and professional contexts. It also supports pre-service teachers as literate and numerate citizens to strengthen positive attitudes, skills, and knowledge about literacy and numeracy roles in everyday contexts. Students will have opportunities to develop their interpersonal, verbal, and non-verbal communication skills. These skills are integral to the inherent requirements of a graduate teacher who will be required to undertake the national literacy and numeracy test mandated by the Australian Government. As a pre-service teacher, students will also develop confidence and competence in their understanding of the roles of literacy and numeracy in society, with particular emphasis on problem-solving and effective communication in practical situations. Students will be provided with opportunities to develop critical self-awareness, self-regulation, and the ability to organise oneself as a self-directed learner. Essential elements of academic scholarship, including information media literacy, understanding assessment, and academic integrity, will be developed.Level: Undergraduate Level 1 subject  Equivalent Subjects: TEAC 1038  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject EDUC 1013  Sociology for Educators(WSTC)  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  This subjectâ€¯includes the study of society, culture, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, and social class.

Developing 'sustainability literacy' requires new ways of thinking and learning that enable us to recognise the connections between environmental concerns, social patterns, and individual actions. This subject approaches key issues in sustainability education with a learner-centred approach that builds skills for inquiry, analysis and creative action and involves a three-hour field trip. It promotes personal and social change, develops civic values, and will empower students to be a leader for a sustainable future.Level: Undergraduate Level 2 subject  Equivalent Subjects: TEAC 2018  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject EDUC 9001  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Centre for Educational Research  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800146  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject EDUC 9002  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Education  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800182  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject EDUC 9003  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Education  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800205  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject
