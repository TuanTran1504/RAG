Internships can take place in a range of policing organisations such as the NSW Police Force, Police Association of NSW, and other member organisations of the Police Federation of Australia. Internship placements will require students to utilise a range of social science skills obtained throughout the Bachelor of Policing (Leadership) and Bachelor of Policing degree programs. This practical work schedule is supported by a reading program that examines different approaches to the study of policing organisations (their structures, functions and policies) and links these issues to the internship experience. The internship provides work at a host organisation for fourteen full days, totalling 105 hours. Typically, this internship component will be realised as one day per week for fourteen weeks, however an alternative spread of work may be agreed between the organisation, the student, and the subject coordinator. The subject is only offered in the Spring session of Level 3, and is worth 10 subjects of credit, which will be recorded as an elective on your degree transcript. There is only one lecture for this subject.Level: Undergraduate Level 3 subject  Co-requisite(s): JUST 3006 ANDCULT 3001  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject JUST 3014  Creating Criminal Justice Solutions  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 102713  In this subject, students will consider some of the contemporary issues faced by the criminal justice system and the possible solutions to these real world problems. Using knowledge and skills drawn from their experience and study in their degree, students will be required to explore a critical policing or criminal justice issue and develop potential solutions. The subject aims to develop skills in problem analysis and managing the practical constraints faced by social scientists working in applied criminal justice and policing settings.  Students will identify a critical issue (such as policing domestic violence, police engagement with CALD youth, criminal justice responses to cybercrimes), which they will explore individually and in groups throughout the semester. Students will become familiar with and learn to apply the policy/practice development cycle to identify critical issues, survey existing research and practices, develop alternative strategies for resolving the identified problem, and evaluating the expected outcomes.Level: Undergraduate Level 3 subject  Equivalent Subjects: JUST 3004 - Contemporary Issues in Criminal Justice and Policing  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject JUST 6001  Comparative International Policing  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  This subject is designed to help you understand why international policing should be considered as an ongoing comparative global endeavour. This subject seeks to explore the possibilities and limitations of comparative international policing from a global perspective by examining policing case studies in both national contexts (for example comparing Australian police organisation’s policing practices) and in international contexts (comparing global police organisation’s policing practices). Within the framework of comparative criminology, we will examine the challenges of international comparative analysis and policing practice, compare national and international police organisations, and examine policing practices in relation to deviance and social response.Level: Postgraduate Coursework Level 6 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject JUST 7006  Legal Internship  (10 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 201064  This subject provides an internship opportunity for Juris Doctor students to be placed in host organisations (including NGOs and public interest organisations, community legal centres, government departments, corporations, barristers' chambers or private law firms). 
Internships provide students with invaluable access to opportunities to critically analyse the law in context, to apply their formal learning about legal principles, to demonstrate professional skills and to gain exposure to different career pathways. 
Students who successfully complete the orientation requirements will spend twelve days throughout the semester at a host organisation. This will usually be done on a one- day (7 hours) per week basis.
An intern's duties will generally consist of a combination of substantive tasks relating to law, policy and practice. Depending on the host organisation, these may include a combination of research, preparing background materials, briefing papers or research reports, liaising with other organisations, assisting in the provision of legal assistance and advice, observing interviews with clients, conferences with Counsel or in court proceedings, undertaking project and advocacy work, preparing/ giving presentations and assisting with administrative and editing work. 
The School will seek expressions of interest for the number of placements available with the School's partner host organisations each semester. 
Students are also able to arrange their own internships at organisations that are not currently host organisations, subject to the approval of the Director / Principal Solicitor and the agreement of the host organisation to complete the attendance and assessment requirements of the subject.
