Because it concerns the manner in which foreign molecules can interact with the body's mechanisms it is of direct relevance not only to the pharmaceutical industry but also to the food, agricultural, cosmetic (etc) industries. It conveys the fascination of designing chemical structures for particular uses within biological systems and which overlap the disciplines of chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology and pharmacology. Emphasis is placed upon design of the chemical structure itself rather than an investigation of the specific chemical structure of its site of action in the body. This is reflected in the laboratory work which traces the historical development of drug design, essentially through a process of a series of inorganic syntheses, relevant to a range of common drugs.Level: Undergraduate Level 3 subject  Equivalent Subjects: LGYA 5935 - Pharmacological Chemistry  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject CHEM 9001  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Functional Genomics  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800144  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject CHEM 9002  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Nanotechnology  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800142  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject CHEM 9003  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Chemical Sciences  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800075  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject CHEM 9004  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Chemistry  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800132  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject CHEM 9005  Higher Degree Research Thesis - Forensics  (80 Credit Points)  Subject Details  Legacy Code: 800158  Level: PhD and Research Masters Level 9 subject  Restrictions: Please see the Subject Details page for any restrictions for this subject
