Academic Handbook Current Edition PROC 4002 Engineering Materials from Waste Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301417 Coordinator Zhong Tao Opens in new window Description Students will learn about the high potential of waste materials produced by continually growing rapid urbanisation and rising populations, which can be widely reused in engineering projects such as  buildings, roads. The focus of this subject is the use of solid waste such as glass, tailings and demolished waste in engineering materials such as concrete, road base and asphalt. In addition, students will explore several recycling and recovery processes and investigate the performance of waste incorporated into engineering materials. Students report on real world state-of-the-art developments while integrating concepts of the circular economy, Australian standards and regulations to ensure the compliance of the developed materials. Work Integrated Leaning (WIL) is a component of this subject.
