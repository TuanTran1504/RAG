The question 'How do we know what we know?' becomes the connecting thread throughout an introduction to quantitative, qualitative and mixed method approaches to practitioner research. Building on considerations from the prerequisite subject WELF6001 Ethics and Diversity in Counselling, students will develop their understanding of research as a scholarly, professional, social and intersubjective practice. They will learn to generate answerable research questions and a coherent research proposal within appropriate intellectual and methodological frameworks.
