Presented as a series of seminar-workshops, candidates consider the theories that underpin the employed analytical methods, and then move to employ introduced qualitative software tools to analyse and interpret research data.

Demonstrate proficiency in citing and referencing a variety of sources. Subject Content Effective qualitative analysis is an increasingly important issue in business research. While there has been growth of interest in the area, quality reporting remains low, largely due to lack of training as to how to analyse and communicate qualitative data. this subject will be present a series of seminars/workshops on current and emerging qualitative analysis techniques to fill this gap. The seminars will consider the methods of qualitative analysis and the theories that underpin them. They will give an overview of the methods employed in business disciplines and attention will be given as to how to choose the best methods for analysing different qualitative data types. The nature and application of specific techniques and combinations of techniques will be covered in greater detail and hands-on analysis opportunities will give insights into effective analysis and its subsequent reporting. The seminars/workshops will highlight the use of two data analysis packages ? NVIVO and Leximancer. NVIVO is a qualitative data analysis computer software package produced and designed for working with very rich text-based and/or multimedia information, where deep levels of analysis on small or large volumes of data is required. Leximancer is a qualitative software analysis package that allows researchers to get text data automatically coded and analysed (rather than the analyst creating and inserting codes). this subject introduces these programs, their basic functions, and presents examples of exemplary original research that have used the programs, in order to give a sense of their possibilities and to highlight how research students might employ them in their own research.
