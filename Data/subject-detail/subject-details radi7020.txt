Academic Handbook Current Edition RADI 7020 Practice of Obstetric and Gynecological (O&G) Sonography 2 Credit Points 10 Coordinator Catherine Robinson Opens in new window Description In this subject, students will continue to develop their image acquisition, optimisation and measurement skills in O&G sonography. They will learn to perform a transvaginal examination to assess the gravid and non-gravid female pelvis. Critique of scanning protocols will allow students to deliver sonographic examinations that address a clinical indication. Students will investigate methods for conveying clinical information and maintaining patient confidentiality and privacy. An applied understanding of medical ethics, workplace health and safety, and reflection frameworks will enhance the provision of high-quality patient care. The subject, which includes a work-integrated learning component, will ensure the consolidation of foundational skills, knowledge and attributes.

For students who complete their clinical training in a NSW public hospital, the necessary legislative requirements will be part of their employment conditions. Clinical training for many of the students will be in a private setting, where the necessary requirements (which are likely to differ from public institutions) will be addressed as needed. Training for some students will occur in states other than NSW (where legislative requirements can be competed if, and when required).
