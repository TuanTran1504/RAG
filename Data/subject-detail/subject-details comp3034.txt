Called Multimodal Interaction, students learn about the variations of such inputs including how speech, vision, gesture and touch are used to interact with computing devices. Through a mixture of theoretical, research-oriented and practical concepts students will be introduced to novel techniques of interacting with computing devices and interfaces and discuss applications of them, across industrial and research applications, including digital assistants such as Siri, Alexa, facial recognition and surveillance systems.
