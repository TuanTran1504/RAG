So how do you make a good business decision? In this subject students will explore the value of numerical data as a tool to help businesspeople make informed decisions using sound evidence. We start with the basics of quantitative data - statistics - as a way of calculating the probable outcomes of particular decisions. We then explore how another crucial set of numbers for a firm - the financials - can also empower businesspeople to make smart decisions.
