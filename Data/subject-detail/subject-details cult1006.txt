Academic Handbook Current Edition CULT 1006 Crime, Deviance and Society (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700156 Coordinator Paul Rouillon Opens in new window Description This subject introduces the major approaches to the study of criminology and the sociology of deviance.  It considers the ways in which social order is produced, maintained and transgressed from a range of perspectives, including the Chicago school, labelling and deviance theory, Marxism, feminism and queer theory.  These perspectives are explored through a discussion of contemporary issues and controversies, such as crime in Western Sydney, the media and moral panic, the criminalisation of HIV transmission, Indigenous incarceration, and alcohol and drug abuse.  The subject also addresses the politics of law and order and the resurgence of neo-liberalism in debates over crime and deviance.
