Academic Handbook Current Edition MATH 7019 Mathematics of Signal Processing Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301440 Coordinator Paul Hurley Opens in new window Description This subject teaches students to abstract and develop algorithms, in Python, for analysing and processing deterministic and stochastic data/signals. Students are taught strategies in developing solutions that are optimal and efficient to implement. They learn how to analyse signals under the Fourier transform and under different bases, allowing for an appreciation of how lossy compression works, and how to formulate and solve some convex optimisation algorithms.
This subject will be undertaken at Parramatta City - Hassall St campus.
