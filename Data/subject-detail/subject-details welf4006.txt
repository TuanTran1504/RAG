Academic Handbook Current Edition WELF 4006 Ideologies of Practice in Social Work Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400517 Coordinator Frances Gale Opens in new window Description Social work practice is not a neutral activity arising from an objective viewpoint but is inextricably bound to varying ideologies and propositions that are concerned with human conduct.  This subject examines the various ideologies that inform psycho-social and political analysis.  Ideologies such as liberalism, critical feminism, critical masculinity, critical class theory, critical race theory, and adultism, and their explanations for psycho-social problems and proposals for change are examined in relation to methods of social work practice.  Students will be encouraged to explore how all theory and practice methods incorporate ideological assumptions and how, therefore, the construction of creative solutions demands practice that is reflective and self-critical.
