Academic Handbook Current Edition MATH 1034 Mathematics for Engineers 1 (Advanced) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301333 Coordinator Stephen Weissenhofer Opens in new window Description This subject will be offered at Engineering Innovation Hub - Hassall St, Parramatta campus.  This subject provides foundational knowledge in key mathematical concepts which are essential for other mathematics subjects in engineering degrees. The subject matter includes: differential and integral calculus of a single variable, complex numbers, aspects of matrix algebra, vectors, and some elementary statistics and probability theory. In applying maths concepts to problems, students develop analytical thinking and problem solving skills, as well as communication skills to present clear and logical arguments. Students are encouraged to be independent and reflective learners in completing tutorial problems and online assessments.
