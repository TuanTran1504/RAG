Academic Handbook Current Edition INFO 7013 Web Engineering Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300443 Coordinator Antoinette Cevenini Opens in new window Description Today organizations extensively rely on web based information systems to market, sell, manage customer relations, and for most of the internal operations. Users are increasingly using mobile devices to interact with this information. Due to rapidly changing business environment these systems need to be designed in away to accommodate the frequent changes. New technologies and frameworks have been developed to support development of large, complex, mobile based, maintainable and evolutionary web systems. In this subject students will study some of these technologies, design methods and frameworks that can be successfully used to engineer such web systems. They will get hands on experience by developing such a system. School Computer, Data & Math Sciences Discipline Information Technology, Not Elsewhere Classified.
