Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 4040 Industrial Design Major Project (Ideation & Studio Practice) Credit Points 20 Coordinator Karen Yevenes Opens in new window Description In this Industrial Design capstone subject, students will immerse themselves in a complex real-world design problem, with considerable social impact, which consolidates their industrial design knowledge and skills.
 
Students will apply themselves in the areas of concept generation and iterative industrial design processes and problem solving. They will incorporate human factors and desirable consumer attributes to produce a creative and novel solution which meets manufactured quality standards and high-level sustainability principles.
 
All learning activities are underpinned by Industrial Design professional practice, as well as research methods for user-centred design, health and wellbeing, digital futures, ergonomics, and sustainable design practice. During their design project, students will engage with industry experts and community groups reinforcing their role, upon graduation, as empathic innovators, and industrial design practitioners with a multidisciplinary viewpoint.
