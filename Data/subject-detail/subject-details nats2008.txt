Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 2008 Clinical Pharmacology Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400981 Coordinator Srinivas Nammi Opens in new window Description This subject explores in depth clinical pharmacology fundamental to the practice of allied health (Physiotherapy, Podiatric Medicine and Paramedicine) and complementary medicine (Traditional Chinese Medicine). General principles of pharmacology will be briefly discussed. This subject imparts detailed knowledge on the classification, mechanism of action, therapeutic effects, clinical applications and side effects of major drug classes acting on musculo-skeletal, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, urinary and reproductive system diseases. In the context of antimicrobial pharmacology, general concepts of microbiology will be introduced offering students an understanding of the causative microorganisms, the complex relationship between host and pathogen, the pharmacological actions, mechanism of action, and clinical uses of antimicrobial drugs and the principles of infection control.
