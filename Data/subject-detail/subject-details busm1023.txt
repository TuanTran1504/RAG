Academic Handbook Current Edition BUSM 1023 Managing People at Work Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200300 Coordinator Sheree Gregory Opens in new window Description Managing People at Work' provides an introductory framework for the study of employment relations. The subject is approached from a stakeholder perspective, emphasising the way that management, labour and the State, along with other key stakeholders, act, both separately and together, to structure the employment relationship. In doing so, the subject integrates industrial relations and human resource management theory and practice, illustrating the links between the two disciplines. The content of the subject is structured so as to provide an initial introduction to the disciplines of industrial relations, human resource management, and employment relations, and to the key stakeholders in the employment relationship. Building on this framework, a theoretical and empirical analysis of employment relations processes is provided, with particular emphasis given to recent changes in the role and perspectives of stakeholders.
