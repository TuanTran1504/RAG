Academic Handbook Current Edition CIVL 2003 Fluid Mechanics Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300762 Coordinator Ataur Rahman Opens in new window Description This subject provides a basic understanding of fluid mechanics principles. Fluid mechanics is the study of the properties and movements of fluids, and key to understanding many of our engineering systems involving fluids, such as power generation, lubrication, irrigation and navigation. While the main focus is on incompressible fluids, effects of compressible fluids are also discussed. The theories learned in classes are reinforced in laboratory sessions. Students analyse fluid systems and apply principles in designing basic pipes and open-channels.
