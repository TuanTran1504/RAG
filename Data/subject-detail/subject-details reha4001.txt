Academic Handbook Current Edition REHA 4001 Clinical Education B (Rehabilitation) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401110 Coordinator Reem Rendell Opens in new window Description This clinical education placement will operationalise the theoretical and research knowledge and skills learnt in the first three years of the course. Students will be required to assess and treat clients in rehabilitation settings. Treatments will be focused on improving client mobility and function that is altered by illness, injury, chronic disease or a disability. This will assist in preparation for client discharge home or to an appropriate residential facility, as well as enhance functioning at home or in the community. Assessment and treatments will tend to have a neurological physiotherapy focus, but clients may also present with cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal conditions which require intervention. Students will, therefore, be expected to integrate knowledge and skills learnt across all physiotherapy-specific units in their provision of client-centred care as well as draw on their more general knowledge from earlier stages of the course.
