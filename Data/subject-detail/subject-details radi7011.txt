Academic Handbook Current Edition RADI 7011 Practice of Vascular Sonography 1 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401293 Coordinator Donna Oomens Opens in new window Description This subject introduces students to the practice of vascular sonography. Students will learn how to acquire and optimise ultrasound images and to make basic measurements. In addition, they will learn to draw conclusions about vascular anatomy and function based on the images and measurements; and they will develop their professional and ethical skills through learning how to plan for and implement a vascular ultrasound examination in a safe and ethical manner. The skills learnt in this unit, which includes a work-integrated component, provide well-rounded, foundation skills in vascular sonography.

Use the link to the Special Requirements webpage below for more information. Western Program Requirements Visit the Special Requirements webpage for details about your program. Special Requirements Mandatory NSW Health student placement policy requirements To be able to undertake placement in any NSW Health facility you must be assessed as compliant with NSW Health student placement policy in the first year of your program, regardless of when you expect to go on your first placement. Access and read the NSW Student Compliance Information Booklet. NSW Student Compliance Information Booklet Please ensure that you Find your existing National Police Check or apply for one  Gather documentary evidence of your vaccination history  Print and compete all relevant NSW Health forms relevant to the campus you are enrolled at or online enrolment requirements  Follow booklet instructions on how to have your compliance documents assessed by NSW health staff. International students have additional requirements; the link to the booklet will inform you of these requirements. School Requirements Contact your School for further details regarding your Schoolâ€™s requirements, if any, such as Student Compliance Resources are also available on the Placements Hub web page (NSW students only) https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/learning_futures/home/placements_hub/placements_hub/student_compliance Legislative requirements (such as a criminal record check) are not deemed necessary for students in the vascular ultrasonography course. For students who complete their clinical training in a NSW public hospital, the necessary legislative requirements will be part of their employment conditions. Clinical training for many of the students will be in a private setting, where the necessary requirements (which are likely to differ from public institutions) will be addressed as needed. Training for some students will occur in locations other than NSW (where legislative requirements can be competed if, and when required).
