Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 1052 Australian Politics and Active Citizenship Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102738 Coordinator Diane Colman Opens in new window Description We live in an increasingly interconnected world where international trade, foreign policy, digital communication and flows of migrants and cultures across borders appear to undermine the importance of national communities. Despite this, everyday life is still profoundly influenced by the decisions which national governments make and the powers they exercise. This subject introduces Australian political institutions, processes and contemporary issues. It traces democracy beyond Parliamentary representation to encompass active citizenship, through which public opinion is formed and expressed. Students will identify key political issues in contemporary Australia, understand how political institutions respond, and develop the skills to contribute to public debates.
