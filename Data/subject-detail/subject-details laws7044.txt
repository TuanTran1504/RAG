Modern legal practice requires lawyers to negotiate settlements on behalf of clients and advise clients how to resolve disputes without litigation. Non-adversarial processes offer many benefits to parties, professionals and the community. This subject introduces students to the theory and practices of alternative dispute resolution processes and provide students with the opportunity to develop key ADR practice. Students will employ cultural awareness and appropriate communication strategies required for professional practice in dispute resolution, particularly in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.
