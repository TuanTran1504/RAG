Academic Handbook Current Edition MEDI 7054 MR Musculoskeletal Imaging (MSK) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401326 Coordinator James Nol Opens in new window Description MR Musculoskeletal �MSK� Imaging is a core subject in the course of Advanced Imaging (MRI). The subject provides students with in-depth knowledge of MSK anatomy and the relevant protocols to create Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences for MSK anatomical regions such as the knee, ankle and hip as well as the spine for different clinical examinations. It is expected that students will develop the ability to recognise normal anatomy, identify common pathologies and be able to provide diagnostic solutions and/or develop new MRI algorithms for clinical problems. They will have the ability to either produce, request or recommend the proper sequence and the best method of operating MRI equipment for the anatomical region in question. The subject is offered to all eligible students with a varied pathway for the two weeks clinical component relevant to their undergraduate discipline. Students will have 2 weeks of clinical training in an MRI clinical site. School Medicine Discipline Radiology Student Contribution Band HECS Band 3 10cp Check your fees via the Fees page.
