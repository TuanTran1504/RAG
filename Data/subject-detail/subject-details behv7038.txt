Academic Handbook Current Edition BEHV 7038 Assessment and Treatment of Complex Psychological Disorders Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102809 Coordinator Daniella Saleme Opens in new window Description Clinical psychology is a fast-evolving discipline, and practitioners need to be able to respond to changing psychological health needs of a diverse population. This subject will prepare students to expand their skills in clinical assessment of psychopathology, diagnosis and psychological interventions to respond to the needs and preferences and cultural values of clients who experience complex and/or chronic psychological disorders. Responsive practice within the context of the changing demands for clinical psychology services is foregrounded, as is the unique context of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.  This subject will explore the theories, techniques and effectiveness of new and emerging psychological therapies; prepare students for working in multidisciplinary teams; and introduce students to the practice of clinical psychology with more complex client groups. The subject will also examine the professional and organisational roles of clinical psychologists within these settings.

Please note: some of the activities in this subject may include experiential learning, for example where students may be asked to take on the client role using their own lived experience, to provide opportunity for training in therapeutic modalities that are more “real-world”. Students may opt-out of these activities without consequence through speaking to the subject coordinator and alternative arrangements for student learning opportunities will be organised.
