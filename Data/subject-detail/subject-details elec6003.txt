This subject is designed to provide students with sufficient understanding to neuromorphic processor. Students will be able to implement spiking neural networks by programming neuromorphic processors The lab work and programming assignments focus on different key aspects of programming neuromorphic processor: Neural modelling, Python programming, debugging code and hardware/software co-simulation. The workshops focus on the concrete implementation of neural networks.
