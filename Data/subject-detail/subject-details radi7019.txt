Academic Handbook Current Edition RADI 7019 Practice of Obstetric and Gynecological (O&G) Sonography 1 Credit Points 10 Coordinator Catherine Robinson Opens in new window Description This subject introduces students to the practice of obstetric and gynecological (O&G) sonography. Students will learn how to acquire and optimise transabdominal ultrasound images and make key measurements. They will learn to draw conclusions about fetal and maternal anatomy and function based on images and measurements. In addition, students will develop their professional and ethical skills by learning how to plan and implement O&G ultrasounds in a safe and ethical manner. The skills and knowledge learnt in this subject, which includes work-integrated learning, provide foundational clinical and professional skills in O&G sonography.

Fetal biometric measurements Special Requirements Legislative pre-requisites Legislative requirements (such as a criminal record check) are not deemed necessary for students in the O&G ultrasonography course. For students who complete their clinical training in a NSW public hospital, the necessary legislative requirements will be part of their employment conditions. Clinical training for many of the students will be in a private setting, where the necessary requirements (which are likely to differ from public institutions) will be addressed as needed. Training for some students will occur in states other than NSW (where legislative requirements can be completed if, and when required) Special Requirements - NSW Health Legislative Prerequisites Pre-requisites Student Compliance Information for all Health-Related Placements Prior to enrolling in this subject, students must have submitted a Student Undertaking Form and undertake to apply for a National Police Check, which is required to be submitted before placement, and a Working with Children Check Student Declaration.
