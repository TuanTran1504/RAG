To this end, to prepare students for HUMN 3101 Social Sciences International Placement (II) the subject examines issues of sustainability and the political and ethical dimensions of volunteering, development and/or fieldwork.  It interrogates the rise of volunteering and learning for development abroad experiences, and provides opportunities for students to reflect on their own part in this growth 'industry'.  Workshops and online activities will cover practical topics such as health and wellbeing, and living and working in development contexts.  They will also provide students with opportunity to learn more about their placement country and/or organisation and to begin developing skills in intercultural communication and interaction, ethnographic observation and reflexivity.
