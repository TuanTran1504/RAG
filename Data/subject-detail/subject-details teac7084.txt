Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 7084 Person-Centred Practice Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102166 Coordinator Christine Johnston Opens in new window Description The shift in educational policy and legislation to one of inclusion has been accompanied by a move to models of service delivery which are person- and family-centred and which also recognise the need for tiers in intervention. Whilst the range of service delivery models currently operating across educational and community settings for varied levels of need and developmental stages will be explored and evaluated, emphasis will be given to person-centred practice. Through an analysis of the literature encompassing both evidence-based practice and practice-based evidence students will evaluate the implications of the model for individuals, families, teachers, other professionals, schools, services, their own practice and for systems practice.
