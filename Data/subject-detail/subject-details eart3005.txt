Level Undergraduate Level 3 subject Pre-requisite(s) EART 4001 Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Apply at-site flood frequency analysis techniques to estimate design floods from recorded streamflow data.
Apply regional flood frequency analysis techniques to estimate design floods when no recorded streamflow data is available.
Apply trend analysis to rainfall and streamflow time series data to check the stationarity of the data.
Apply linear regression analysis to develop prediction models to estimate streamflow and rainfall indices.
Apply multivariate statistical techniques to hydrological problems.
Evaluate current Australian codes and software to solve statistical hydrological problems.
Critically evaluate current literature to benchmark recent problems and developments in statistical hydrology practice.
