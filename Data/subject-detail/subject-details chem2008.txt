Academic Handbook Current Edition CHEM 2008 Organic Chemistry Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300876 Coordinator Christopher Gordon Opens in new window Description Organic molecules are at the heart of the chemistry of life and industry. This subject builds on the fundamental chemical principles, exploring reaction mechanisms and the concept of reactivity and stereo- and regio-selectivity of many of the central reactions that form the basis of living processes, modern research, and contemporary industrial transformations. The subject contains a problem-based module on the application of spectroscopic methods to organic structure elucidation, focusing on spectroscopic data and a practical section on organic synthesis. The subject will focus on complex organic molecules including biologically relevant molecules, and examples from chemical industries, medicinal and pharmaceutical industries.
