Academic Handbook Current Edition PUBH 6002 Systems Science and Population Health Credit Points 10 Coordinator Sandro Martins Sperandei Opens in new window Description This subject will introduce students to applications of system science methods to population health problems in epidemiology that can be used to guide policy and program decision making. Students will be provided with an overview of the sorts of problems that might benefit from system science techniques, and the different types of dynamic modelling methods that can be used (e.g. system dynamics models, agent-based models) using a series of case studies focussing on a range of chronic disease outcomes. Participants will also have the opportunity to interact with example models, to explore model structures, underlying assumptions, and conduct scenario testing of suites of policy interventions.
