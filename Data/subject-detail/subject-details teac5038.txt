Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 5038 Technology Curriculum 3 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102883 Coordinator Dorian Stoilescu Opens in new window Description In this subject, the place of Technology and applied STEM in secondary curriculum will be further explored using evidence-based approaches for curriculum development and alignment and to plan for effective teaching and learning, including formative and summative assessment. Pre-service teachers will learn approaches for teaching a range of Technologies using STEM pedagogy. They will focus on assessment design for project and problem-based learning. The subject will demonstrate approaches for engaging diverse senior secondary learners. Pre-service teachers will develop subject and assessment plans and demonstrate a knowledge of curriculum, learning and assessment theory. The subject requires students to develop original portfolio of teaching artefacts that demonstrate capacity to create and critique resources for effective teaching and learning in Technology.
