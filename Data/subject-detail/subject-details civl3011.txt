Academic Handbook Current Edition CIVL 3011 Hydraulics Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300765 Coordinator Kejun Dong Opens in new window Description The subject covers the principles of open channel hydraulics, pipe hydraulics and culvert hydraulics.  Specific topics in open channel hydraulics include uniform flow, resistance equations, specific energy principle, flow types, gradually varied flow and rapidly varied flow.  The purpose is to enable design of efficient open channels to meet engineering requirements.  In addition, principles of pipe and culvert hydraulics are introduced, enabling analysis and design of pipe networks and culverts.
