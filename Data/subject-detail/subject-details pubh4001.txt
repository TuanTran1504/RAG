Academic Handbook Current Edition PUBH 4001 Evidence in Professional Reasoning (Honours) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401379 Coordinator Caroline Mills Opens in new window Description In this subject, students will incorporate the evidence knowledge and skills developed from previous subjects in professional practice. The evidence-based practice process manages expanding and uncertain knowledge by formulating answerable questions, effectively searching literature, critically appraising evidence and applying and evaluating its significance in clinical practice and healthcare decision-making. Professional reasoning requires consideration of best available evidence, client or patient perspectives, professional expertise and practice context. Students will learn professional reasoning for shared decision-making, and safe and effective communication for patient scenarios relevant to your program. Students will study the theory and application of research methods to honours research in their chosen field, and practise the skills to analyse evidence in the health sciences.
