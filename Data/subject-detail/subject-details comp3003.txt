Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 3003 Cloud Computing Architecture Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301204 Coordinator Rodrigo Neves Calheiros Opens in new window Description This subject, the second part of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Academy Cloud Computing Architecture curriculum, provides deeper understanding about advanced cloud computing services and how to architect cloud applications that are scalable, reliable, and efficient in terms of cost and performance. Students will learn advanced cloud computing concepts including notification and messaging, serverless computing, API gateways, NoSQL databases, content delivery networks, stream processing, and long-term storage. The subject also covers advanced cloud security and infrastructure automation. All these aspects are explored in practice with AWS services. Upon completion of this subject, students will be prepared for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam.
