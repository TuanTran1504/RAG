Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 7006 Data Science Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301044 Coordinator Liwan Liyanage Opens in new window Description The explosion of data in the internet age opens up new possibilities for agencies and business to better serve and market to its customers. To take full advantage of these opportunities requires the ability to consolidate, manage and extract information from very large diverse data sets. In science, data sets are growing rapidly, with projects routinely generating terabytes of data. In this subject we examine the software tools and analytic methods that underpin a successful Data Science Project and gain experience in big data analytics.
