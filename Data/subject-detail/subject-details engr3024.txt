Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 3024 Design Research Methods (Advanced) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301291 Coordinator Mauricio Novoa Opens in new window Description Design and user research methods are critical in establishing efficient and effective processes around resource utilisation in designing, conducting and presenting research findings that are succinct yet open to new innovations. A range of advanced research design methods are presented and students are guided to the strategic selection of methods appropriate to their own self-sourced project theme. Data collection instruments are designed, operationalised, data coded and analysed via both qualitative and quantitative techniques and discussed in a vibrant peer environment inspired by design thinking and other research methods unique to the design profession and within university human ethics policy protocols.
