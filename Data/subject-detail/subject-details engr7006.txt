Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 7006 Fire Engineering 1 (Fire Dynamics) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300709 Coordinator Sameera Wijesiri Pathirana Opens in new window Description This subject aims to develop a detailed knowledge of fire behaviour and dynamics in the built environment. Students will be able to understand fuels and combustion processes; the chemistry of combustion; flammability limits; ignition characteristics; and different types of flames and fire plumes. The content also covers the burning of liquids and solids; flammable vapour/air mixtures; extinction and extinguishment; flame spread mechanisms and modeling; flashover; fire resistance and fire severity; projection of flames from burning compartment openings; spread of fire from a compartment; production and measurement of smoke; and smoke movement.
