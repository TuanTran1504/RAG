Academic Handbook Current Edition LAWS 3027 Human Rights Law Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200635 Coordinator Robert Mezyk Opens in new window Description This subject examines the theory and practice of international human rights law through the framework of specific, current human rights issues. The Subject examines the moral and political justification for human rights; the foundations and historical development of key human rights instruments and institutions; the domestic, regional and global organisations that contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights; and challenges to realising human rights in different economic, cultural and religious contexts. Through a focus on contemporary issues and debates (which might include for example, the scope of the right to privacy; the effectiveness of measures to prevent genocide; the vulnerability of women and children in conflict situations) the Subject encourages a critical examination of the interconnectedness of rights and the way international human rights law is deployed to expand (or constrain) possibilities for social change and justice. The subject integrates the experience of the teachers as active human rights practitioners and academics in a range of institutions such as with National Human Rights Institutions, Human Rights NGOs,  and Subjected Nations bodies to interrogate the range of ways in which human rights can be used to advance the equality and dignity of humanity.
