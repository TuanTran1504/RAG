The subject considers how the great religions/philosophies of Asian societies - Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and Confucianism - have influenced Asian states and relations between them. It explores other forces which have shaped the civilisations, polities and communities of Asia and how they have related to each other and the world beyond.
