Academic Handbook Current Edition RADI 7008 Principles of Cardiac Sonography 3 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401187 Coordinator Paul Stoodley Opens in new window Description In 2024, this subject replaced by RADI 6002 - Research Foundations for Sonography. This subject will extend the knowledge students have gained from Principles of Cardiac Sonography 2. Students will utilise their knowledge of normal and abnormal cardiac anatomy and physiology to study congenital and acquired heart lesions. They will examine systemic, pulmonary and pericardial diseases and cardiac masses, analyse data from basic echocardiogram measurements, and learn case study research skills by undertaking a case report. The university library's vast resources will provide an important aid to learning in this subject.
