Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 1026 Global Structures, Local Cultures Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102345 Coordinator Mary Hawkins Opens in new window Description Globalisation has created a world of convergence and, at the same time, of division. Nations appear now to be less sovereign and more limited, as their political, economic and cultural systems become enmeshed within, and in some instances subordinate to, a world system. Similarly, certain cultural styles, from the choice of footwear to neo-liberal politics, have become part of a global culture. However, while we as citizens are becoming increasingly international, we as humans are looking for meaning in smaller, local, communities. Globalisation has not, it seems, created an homogenous world culture, but rather, a world in which citizens participate in, and identify with, both global and local cultures. This subject traces the emergence of a global society and culture and, through the use of case studies drawn from throughout the world, examines the links between global structures and local cultures.
