Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 1001 3D Modelling Fundamentals Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301164 Coordinator Tomas Trescak Opens in new window Description This subject will introduce the fundamentals of 3D surface modelling. Students will learn the theory of 3D surface modelling and will gain practical skills in creating 3D assets using a popular software package from Autodesk. They will also learn how to design characters and how to integrate their assets with a purpose of producing complex 3D scenes and animated movies. This subject is aimed at students who have no prior knowledge of 3D modelling and are not familiar with associated software packages.
