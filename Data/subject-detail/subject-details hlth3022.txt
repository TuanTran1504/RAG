Academic Handbook Current Edition HLTH 3022 Paramedicine Leadership Credit Points 10 Description This subject introduces students to Paramedicine leadership in the context of an emerging profession. Students will undertake a 4-week clinical placement block with an emergency ambulance crew, which will, in part, be used as a basis for reflective learning activities and critical analysis. Students will explore and discuss concepts of organisational and clinical leadership and supervision, drawing from their clinical placement and other experiences. Students will learn about leadership styles, principles of clinical education, mentoring and supervision strategy, as well as risk assessment, mass casualty and organisational behaviour. Staff wellness, organisational efficiency and sustainable practices will be common goals to aspire to. This ground-up leadership is intended to contribute to organisational success and mitigates the risk of victimology among new entrants to the field.
