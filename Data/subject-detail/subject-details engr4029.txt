Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 4029 Industrial Design Project (Completion) Credit Points 40 Legacy Code 300774 Coordinator Richard Yang Opens in new window Description The Industrial Design Honours Program provides students with an opportunity to apply their industrial design skills to an in-depth year long design research project. In Industrial Design Major Project (Completion), Honours candidates respond to the research findings and design brief that they produced in Autumn semester. They undertake detailed design development to resolve and communicate a final design solution, which is publicly exhibited at the end of the year. Their design and research communications present a strong argument for the final design and demonstrate the honours candidates capacity to undertake postgraduate design research and to join professional design practice.
