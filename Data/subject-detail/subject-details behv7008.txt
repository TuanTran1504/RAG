Academic Handbook Current Edition BEHV 7008 Clinical Health Psychology Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 101220 Coordinator Janet Conti Opens in new window Description In this subject students acquire an understanding of how biological, psychological, social factors interact in health and illness, and how the principles of biopsychosocial models of health inform clinical psychology intervention strategies that can be applied to the management of physical disorders. This subject will cover psychological assessment, formulation that integrates medicine and psychology, clinical health psychology treatments and assessment of their outcomes.  Given that comorbidity has an impact on health outcomes, psychological practice when working with co-morbid substance use disorders will also be addressed. Practice within this branch of clinical psychology requires working within inter-disciplinary treatment contexts that include medical interventions and the tailoring of psychological interventions to help manage a medical condition and enhance quality of life. The subject includes culturally responsive attitudes and skills in clinical health psychology practice, including when working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.
