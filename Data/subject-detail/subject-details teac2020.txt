Responsive teaching engages students holistically in learning that is tailored to meet their physical, cognitive, social, emotional and developmental needs. This subject will consider the learning needs and styles of primary children, including Indigenous children.  It will introduce key approaches to instruction based on theories and research in educational psychology. A particular focus will be the development of children’s sense of self and the ways that children’s school experiences interact with cultural and familial influences to shape identity, motivation and engagement throughout the primary years. Particular emphasis is given to developing responsive teaching practices which promote social and emotional wellbeing of children and are underpinned by high-quality relationships which extend to include the valuing of families and the wider community.
