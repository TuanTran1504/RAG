This subject takes this multi-faceted approach by utilising the knowledge gained in earlier subjects and applying it to case studies. Building on the subject 'Integrated Business Experience 1', an international focus provides participants with the opportunity to consider issues on a broader scale.  Students will be expected to work with a group simulation to solve common issues facing organisations and policy makers using critical, integrative and creative thinking.
