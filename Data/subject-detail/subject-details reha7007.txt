Academic Handbook Current Edition REHA 7007 Integrating Research into Physiotherapy Practice Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401050 Coordinator Clarice Tang Opens in new window Description From 2018 students should take 401109 Integrating Research into Physiotherapy Practice. In this subject, students will further develop their evidence based practice skills and knowledge by applying it in practice settings. This will involve applying the academic knowledge and skills from three prior evidence based practice and research subjects by synthesising it with their clinical experience and skills. Students will be allocated a topic area from which they will identify a clinical "problem" or health-related issue. Students will then plan and design a robust research project to answer this question. Students will be expected to reflect on the barriers and facilitators of evidence-based practice, and develop strategies and interventions to be used to facilitate the implementation of evidence in practice by clients and health care practitioners. This subject also involves students developing leadership and educator skills by facilitating and participating in a journal club.
