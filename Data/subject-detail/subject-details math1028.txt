Academic Handbook Current Edition MATH 1028 Statistical Decision Making Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300700 Coordinator Volker Gebhardt Opens in new window Description Statistical Decision Making introduces students to various statistical techniques for analysing and interpreting data.  Presentation of the content will emphasise the correct principles and procedures for collecting and analysing data, using statistical software.  Topics include describing different sets of data, probability distributions, statistical inference, and simple linear regression and correlation. 
The open-source statistical software package R will be introduced and used in this subject.

Analysing and interpreting data is crucial in many sectors of modern economy and society.  Thus, basic competencies in statistics, data collection and data analysis are essential employability skills in virtually every profession.
