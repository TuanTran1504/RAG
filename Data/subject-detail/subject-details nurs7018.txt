Academic Handbook Current Edition NURS 7018 Contemporary Professional Practice in Mental Health Nursing Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400220 Coordinator Gihane Endrawes Opens in new window Description Professional practice in Mental Health Nursing is continually evolving to meet changing social, political and legal requirements related to mental health issues. These requirements include changes in social and political understandings of mental illness and the rights and responsibilities of consumers, carers and providers. There has also been increased emphasis on health promotion, prevention and education in population specific contexts (eg, aged care, child and family, adolescent mental health, alcohol and other drugs services). Mental Health Nurses thus face challenges to develop practice that is congruent with the context of these changing requirements. This subject aims to provide a basis of inquiry into contemporary practice(s) from which the nurse can build an ongoing understanding and appreciation of changing influences.
