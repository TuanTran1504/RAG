Academic Handbook Current Edition CHEM 3001 Advanced Analytical Chemistry Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300925 Coordinator Andrew Shalliker Opens in new window Description This subject builds on Analytical Chemistry 2 and focuses more on instrumental analysis, isolation and cleanup techniques and aspects of quality control and quality assurance in an analytical laboratory and in manufacturing are discussed. The instrumental methods covered include atomic spectroscopy (for example, atomic absorption and emission, x-ray fluorescence), molecular spectroscopy (for example, UV-Vis, IR, fluorometry, mass spectrometry), chromatography, electrochemistry, thermal methods and automated methods. The theory of the instrumental methods, their construction, operation and applications are covered. The theory and application of isolation and cleanup techniques in inorganic and organic residue analysis are given. School Science Discipline Chemical Sciences, Not Elsewhere Classified.
