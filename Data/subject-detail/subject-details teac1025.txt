Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 1025 Mathematical Patterns and Relationships (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700137 Coordinator Rubie Herrera Opens in new window Description Students will use a variety of investigative techniques to highlight the evidence of patterns and relationships in mathematics. The inherent structure of mathematics will be approached through the examination of various mathematical systems. In addition, students will examine the nature of mathematical thought including inductive and deductive reasoning. This subject contributes directly to the achievement of a sound foundation in mathematics.
