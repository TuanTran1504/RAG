Academic Handbook Current Edition INFS 2006 Object Oriented Analysis Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300144 Coordinator Jiansheng Huang Opens in new window Description The core strength of this subject is to analyse and model business objectives and critical requirements of software systems to be developed using object-oriented (OO) approaches. The system analysis is taken to greater depths within the context of Object Orientation. The Unified Modelling Language version 2.0 (notably use cases, user case diagrams, activity diagrams, class diagrams and sequence diagrams) is used as the modelling standard for creating OO models in the problem space. The subject also covers the rational unified process methodology and applications of design patterns for software development through practical case studies.
