This subject has a series of software engineering workshops designed to teach students to work in teams and apply their knowledge to solve real-life problems. These workshops offer students opportunities to concentrate on software requirements analysis and design issues including artefacts produced as well techniques and tools to support this process (brainstorming, problem statements, requirements elicitation, producing design documents and prototyping). In addition, it provides students with some teamwork skills, requirements engineering and design techniques that an engineer would use in the early stages of the development process. The students are also getting experience on different aspects of designing a Web application with a major focus on the front-end.
