Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 1001 Concepts in Human Anatomy Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301126 Coordinator Hayley Green Opens in new window Description This subject provides a basic understanding of human embryological development, anatomical terminology, and a range of foundation concepts in human anatomy.  Students must attend a 'wet' laboratory session where the learning of anatomy will be enhanced through the study of human cadaveric material. Wet laboratory sessions are not available on all campuses, and therefore students will need to travel to other campuses in order to attend.
