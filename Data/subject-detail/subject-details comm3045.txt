The subject provides the opportunity to link and apply theoretical understanding with research, writing, planning, creative development and media, and presentation skills in response to a live client brief provided by a multi-national advertising agency. The 'real world' situation allows students to demonstrate their capacity for problem analysis and to develop appropriate and timely solutions. Students will  work within an allocated budget and to realistic industry deadlines to produce a campaign they can include in their portfolio. Assessment tasks will enable students to demonstrate emerging professional  capacity and prepare themselves for a communication position, either in an advertising agency, media agency or consultancy.
