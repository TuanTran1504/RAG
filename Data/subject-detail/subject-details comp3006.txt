Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 3006 Computer Graphics Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300093 Coordinator Hanh Nguyen Vo Opens in new window Description Computer Graphics will examine elementary graphics concepts, algorithms and programming skills for producing graphical applications, in both two-dimension (2D) and three-dimension (3D) using Open GL. Techniques and algorithms will be programmed in Processing, which is a very easy-to-learn programming language yet powerful and comprehensive.
