Academic Handbook Current Edition REHA 3007 Exercise Prescription II Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401144 Coordinator Peter Clothier Opens in new window Description This subject focuses on the role of exercise in the functional rehabilitation of musculoskeletal injuries including work and sporting injuries. It covers injury and re-injury prevention strategies; mechanisms of injury; patho-physiology of injury and repair process; design and evaluation of rehabilitation exercise programs; how the exercise program functions in concert with other methods of injury treatment and management; important pharmacological, communication, psychosocial and cultural considerations; the role of the exercise physiologist in the rehabilitation team; the effects of nervous system disorders and injury on skeletal muscle control, injury and rehabilitation are also considered.
