It teaches students to take account of the differing ways that forms of desire, pleasure, obscenity, pornography, perversion, sin and transgression have been articulated across time and place. In the subject we traverse an array of temporal moments and geographic loci, drawn to the 'hotspots' of historiographic contention.
