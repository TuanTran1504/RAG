Throughout the semester students will further develop their design, research and presentation skills. This will be achieved through employment of appropriate design/research skills to finish a capstone project, either design-oriented or research-oriented project, which demonstrates student's professional level of executing, testing, documenting an engineering project and completing a technical report.
