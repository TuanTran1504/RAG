Two self-directed online learning modules with digitalized images and practical notes on the diagnostic approach to important pathological entities of the above sub-specialties will be provided. The basic concepts in surgical, cyto- and small biopsy pathology, including the appropriate ancillary techniques in the diagnosis, prognostication and treatment prediction will be assessed. This subject is designed to further develop the basic research and communication skills, and critical thinking acquired in Surgical Pathology I, and to reinforce the resources and technical requirements needed to reach the correct pathological diagnosis.
