Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 7076 Multicultural Nonverbal Communication Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102283 Coordinator Ping Yang Opens in new window Description This subject introduces students to the interdisciplinary fields of linguistics, communication and cultural semiotics. It builds links between these areas of studies and beyond, which provide students with knowledge of how human beings use nonverbal communication systems and channels to achieve effective communication in intercultural and multicultural contexts. This subject covers three key perspectives, including paralinguistics, proxemics and kinesics. Authentic audio and visual materials are used to facilitate students' awareness of the multidimensional process in which people communicate verbally and nonverbally simultaneously. It also helps enhance their sensitivity when they interact with people from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds.
