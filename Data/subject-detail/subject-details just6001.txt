Academic Handbook Current Edition JUST 6001 Comparative International Policing Credit Points 10 Coordinator Toby Miles-Johnson Opens in new window Description This subject is designed to help you understand why international policing should be considered as an ongoing comparative global endeavour. This subject seeks to explore the possibilities and limitations of comparative international policing from a global perspective by examining policing case studies in both national contexts (for example comparing Australian police organisation’s policing practices) and in international contexts (comparing global police organisation’s policing practices). Within the framework of comparative criminology, we will examine the challenges of international comparative analysis and policing practice, compare national and international police organisations, and examine policing practices in relation to deviance and social response.
