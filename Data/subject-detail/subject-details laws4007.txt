Academic Handbook Current Edition LAWS 4007 International Environmental Law Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200801 Coordinator Maria Gurlica Opens in new window Description This course provides a general introduction to international environmental law and policy. We will begin by exploring the economic, political, and legal concepts relevant to international environmental treaty regimes. We will then apply these concepts to concrete regimes designed to deal with specific international environmental problems, such as ozone depletion, transboundary air pollution, freshwater resources, marine pollution, world heritage, human rights, biodiversity and habitat loss. The course focuses principally on the dynamic of treaties, negotiations, and state and non-state actors in the international arena. Comparative approaches to national implementation, on selected issues, will also be covered.
