Academic Handbook Current Edition BEHV 3014 Motivation and Emotion Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 101678 Coordinator Tim Marsh Opens in new window Description The study of motivation and emotion explores the reasons behind people's behaviours, thoughts, and feelings. This subject examines core research and theory on motivational and emotional systems, exploring how these systems function in general and how that functioning varies due to gender, culture, and other sources of difference. Concepts of motivation and emotion are central to understanding human psychology. The subject positions the topic in relation to other areas of psychological theory (such as learning theory, social psychology, personality, and cognition), investigates its role in psychological practice, and addresses its impact upon practical and philosophical debates within the discipline. Students are encouraged to explore and reflect upon the role of motivational systems in their own lives.
