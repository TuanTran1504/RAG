Academic Handbook Current Edition ELEC 2019 Workshop on Reasoning about Programs Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301347 Coordinator Richard Yang Opens in new window Description This subject will be offered at Engineering Innovation Hub - Hassall St, Parramatta campus.  The goal of this subject is to develop skills in writing precise specifications of software programs and to translate these specifications into correct implementations. Further methods for reasoning about programs are introduced, including methods for reasoning about termination, program refinement and data refinement. Students learn to apply these ideas to structure their thinking about programs as well as to build a web application within a project context.
