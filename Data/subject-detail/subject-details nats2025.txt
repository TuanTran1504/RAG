Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 2025 Natural Science Research Methods Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300932 Coordinator Clarissa House Opens in new window Description This subject aims to introduce students to the theories and practices underpinning the scientific processes. Students will learn to identify an issue, review the literature to identify gap(s) and formulate a hypothesis or a question to address the gap(s). Students will then explore research methods and designs to safely and ethically conduct an experiment or study to collect data to answer the hypothesis/question. They will also learn to analyse and interpret the data and report on the findings of the research in a written format. The subject is structured so that lectures will provide theoretical expertise and workshops will reinforce student learning with practical experience. This knowledge and skills are essential for stage 3 subjects and a career in science. School Science Discipline Natural and Physical Sciences, Not Elsewhere Classified.

Reflect on practices and experiences for personal and professional development Subject Content 1. Conceptualising a research project:
- what do You see as A question (theoretical or applied): usually derived from observation in The work place, everyday life, nature, news articles, magazines & journals
- Background reading to confirm that is A Problem worthy of research: introduce students to different types of literature
- Skills to learn: library searches; assessing literature through skim reading of publishers, tittles, abstract, headings/sub-headings & captions
2. Locating, reviewing the literature to identify gaps:
- what is A lit Review, how is It conducted
- what are gaps and how to identify them (from what is known and unknown)
- skills to learn: organising own research database, making notes and mind-Mapping to identify themes of what is known, what is not known, and gaps
3. Identifying the aim of the research, formulate hypothesis or research question(s):
- structure of A Hypothesis/ question(s)
4. Research methods and research designs:
- data sources (i.e. Surveys, quantitative, quantitative etc.)
- data collection tools (i.e. sample size, units of replication etc.)
5. Ethical and regulatory frameworks involved in research on humans and animals:
- Skills to learn: undertaking and documenting risk assessment as appropriate to their proposed research activities; completing an ethical application
6. Managing a project:
- Skills to learn: use of Gantt chart; recording and protecting data
7. Types of data and basic methods to analyse data:
- what statistical test is appropriate for The data?
- what The data tell You in relation to The Hypothesis or questions ? tools to present results (tables, Graphs, stats)
- what are your conclusions based on The Hypothesis or questions?
- how do The conclusions relate to current research literature? are they consistent or expand on The literature? are they inconsistent and why?
- skills to learn: Integrating Numerical evidence to support arguments
8. Academic writing:
- structure of A research proposal and A research report
