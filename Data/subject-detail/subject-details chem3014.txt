Because it concerns the manner in which foreign molecules can interact with the body's mechanisms it is of direct relevance not only to the pharmaceutical industry but also to the food, agricultural, cosmetic (etc) industries. It conveys the fascination of designing chemical structures for particular uses within biological systems and which overlap the disciplines of chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology and pharmacology. Emphasis is placed upon design of the chemical structure itself rather than an investigation of the specific chemical structure of its site of action in the body. This is reflected in the laboratory work which traces the historical development of drug design, essentially through a process of a series of inorganic syntheses, relevant to a range of common drugs.

Level Undergraduate Level 3 subject Equivalent Subjects LGYA 5935 - Pharmacological Chemistry Assumed Knowledge This subject is aimed at undergraduates with a grounding in chemistry and biochemistry. Learning Outcomes Obtain an understanding of the classification of drugs by chemical structure, by pharmacological effect, by target, and by site of action
Identify the type of physicochemical and chemical forces that govern the interaction of a drug with its target
Obtain an understanding of the stereochemical and conformational requirements of drug-target interactions
