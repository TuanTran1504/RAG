Academic Handbook Current Edition MATH 1026 Quantitative Thinking Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300831 Coordinator Patrick O'Doherty Opens in new window Description This subject develops the quantitative skills that underpin many fields of study in the sciences. The content covered includes basic algebra, functions, graphs, equations, linear and quadratic, introductory probability and descriptive statistics. These mathematical/statistical concepts will be revised and developed using scientific concepts such as molarity and dilution, optical density, population growth, and predator-prey models. In all aspects of this subject, students will be developing and using critical thinking skills to solve mathematical/statistical problems set in a scientific context.
