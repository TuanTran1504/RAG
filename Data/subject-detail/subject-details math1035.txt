Academic Handbook Current Edition MATH 1035 Mathematics for Engineers 2 (Advanced) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301337 Coordinator Stephen Weissenhofer Opens in new window Description This subject will be offered at Engineering Innovation Hub - Hassall St, Parramatta campus.  This subject covers a number of topics that build on calculus knowledge from Mathematics for Engineers 1 (Advanced). Calculus is essential for engineering as it involves studying how things change over small intervals of time and allows for modelling such changes. Topics include ordinary differential equations, Laplace transforms and multi-variable calculus. In applying mathematical concepts to problems, students develop analytical thinking and problem solving skills, as well as communication skills to present clear and logical arguments. Students are encouraged to be independent and reflective learners in completing tutorial problems and online assessments.
