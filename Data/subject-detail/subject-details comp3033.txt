Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 3033 Quantum Computing and Communication Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301437 Coordinator Weisheng Si Opens in new window Description This subject discusses how computing and communication can be performed by utilising subatomic particles in quantum world, a way very different from classical computing. From a computer science perspective, this subject skips the details of quantum physics and directly explains the concepts of qubits and quantum circuits for the purpose of computing. Necessary mathematical preliminaries are included. Then, this subject discusses major quantum algorithms and communication protocols. Quantum programming will be practised throughout this subject with quantum simulators and real quantum computers in clouds. Students completing this subject will develop skills for designing quantum algorithms/protocols and conducting quantum programming and can pursue careers such as quantum software engineers, quantum security engineers or quantum researchers.

COMP1014 Assumed Knowledge Students should have gained knowledge and skills in basic probability theory and intermediate-level computer programming. The basics of probability are essential for understanding quantum states. Computer programming skills of using objects and simple algorithms are needed to compose quantum programs.
Linear Algebra, which is the foundation for the mathematical models in quantum computing, will be covered within the subject. Therefore, a prior knowledge on it is recommended, but not required. Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Apply the mathematical models enabled by Quantum Mechanics.
Compose quantum circuits to implement programming logics.
Design quantum algorithms that are faster than classical algorithms.
Design secure quantum communication protocols.
Apply techniques for correcting quantum errors.
