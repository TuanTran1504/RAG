Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 1037 Exploring Patterns and Relationships in Mathematics Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102795 Coordinator Kate Mulkern Opens in new window Description This subject supports pre-service teachers in the understanding of mathematical processes and content. Pre-service teachers will develop competence and confidence in the content areas of Number and Algebra, Measurement and Geometry; Probability and Statistics. They will be able to solve problems related to these areas and communicate their solution methods, using processes from the Working Mathematically strand. This subject is included in the Foundation Phase of the Bachelor of Education.
