Academic Handbook Current Edition MATH 2003 Differential Equations Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200030 Coordinator Shatha Aziz Opens in new window Description Differential equations arise naturally both in abstract mathematics and in the study of many phenomena.  This subject provides the theory of ordinary differential equations and an introduction to partial differential equations together with methods of solution.  Examples are drawn from a wide range of biological, chemical, physical and economic applications.
