Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 2012 Anthropologies of the Everyday Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102347 Coordinator Geir Henning Presterudstuen Opens in new window Description In 2021, this subject replaced by 102844 - Society, Culture and Human Diversity.  Although people's lives vary significantly depending on ethnographic context, it is also through everyday practices and rituals that the universality of the human condition becomes most obvious. Close studies of how people create a living and make meaning of their everyday experiences in various contexts can thus provide valuable lessons about cultural difference as well as about what it means to be human, and is consequently a core aspect of anthropological inquiry. In this subject students engage with this overarching theme via ethnographic case studies as well as through inquiries into their own everyday lives.
