Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 7027 Advanced Data Engineering Credit Points 10 Description Data Engineers play a crucial role in designing data systems tailored to certain specifications. While several software modules can be used for constructing data systems, a Data Engineer must be able to identify the inner mechanisms underlying these systems, thereby gauging their suitability. In this subject, students will delve into the intricacies of modern-day data system design and algorithms, ensuring these systems' reliability, scalability, and ease of maintenance. Furthermore, we will explore common problems affecting data systems in the hardware and software space and identify their implications. In addition, students will investigate algorithms and data structures that optimise the storage and flow of data through data systems.
