Academic Handbook Current Edition BUSM 7025 Diversity, Labour Markets and Workforce Planning Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200828 Coordinator Michael Lyons Opens in new window Description Demographic change, economic cycles and labour force participation patterns influence the manner in which HRM functions are conducted. This subject focuses on the way an organisation's external environment impacts on both strategic and workforce maintenance planning. The subject is designed to enable employment relations professionals and managers to plan for organisational sustainability, managing workforce-related risk, and growth. The emphasis on labour markets, workforce diversity and planning allows for accommodation of demographic changes, human capital shortages and economic cycles when planning for labour supply and labour demand requirements. While the aim is to identify gaps between the present and future human capital needs - and implementing solutions so the organisation can accomplish its mission, goals, and objectives - the difficulty of this systematic and proactive process increases with the complexity of an organisation and the longer the time horizon used in the planning.
