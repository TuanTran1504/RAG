Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 1005 Programming Fundamentals Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300580 Coordinator Anton Bogdanovych Opens in new window Description As a first subject in computer programming, Programming Fundamentals covers the basics of developing software with an emphasis on procedural programming. Students will learn about basic data structures, the concept of algorithms, fundamental programming constructs, common programming language features and functions, program design and good programming style. A high level programming language is combined with a highly visual framework to teach problem solving using software.

Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: With a chosen programming language in mind , analyse a given problem and from a simple problem description, identify desired inputs, outputs, and the necessary processing operations to convert input into output;
Develop an algorithm that applies structured programming techniques that solve the given problem;
Choose suitable data types to store relevant data for the given problem;
Design and code programs which use standard programming concepts: variables, sequence, loops, decision making constructs, mathematical and boolean operators, as well as functions;
Apply top-down modular design principles to programming problems and implement the solution using the chosen programming language. Subject Content 1. Fundamentals of procedural programming including: a. variables and data types; b. performing calculations; c. sequence; d. compound statements; e. decision making constructs; f. looping constructs; g. problem solving techniques; h. writing and using functions; i. one dimensional arrays
