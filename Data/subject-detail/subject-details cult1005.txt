It considers the ways in which social order is produced, maintained and transgressed from a range of perspectives, including the Chicago school, labelling and deviance theory, Marxism, feminism, and post-colonial theory.  These perspectives are explored through a discussion of contemporary issues and controversies, such as terrorism, asylum seeking, the criminalisation of protest, Indigenous incarceration, alcohol and other drug use, and transnational crime.
