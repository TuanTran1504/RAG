It extends students' understanding of the processes and uses of participatory action research, also known in this context as teacher-based inquiry. It reviews theories on engaging practices in diverse professional contexts, with a focus on working with students from low socio-economic backgrounds, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island learners and students who have English as an additional language or dialect (EAL/D). It also reviews pedagogic approaches linked to 21st century education. It challenges students to inquire into and reflect upon their professional practice and develop engaging classroom pedagogies and assessment practices in the area of their primary teaching specialisation (English, Mathematics or Science and Technology). The subject expands students' research skills through the critical review and application of various approaches to document, measure and evaluate student engagement. In line with NESA primary teaching specialisation requirements, students must apply these research skills and understandings to their school, classroom context and selected curriculum area specialisation. This subject is included in the Transition Phase of the Master of Teaching program.
