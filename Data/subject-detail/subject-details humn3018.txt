Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 3018 Australian Indigenous History: From first contact to 'dying race' Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 101919 Coordinator Timothy Rowse Opens in new window Description Until 1788, Australia was peopled by those who we now call Aborigines. Then Europeans arrived and began to spread across the continent, displacing and marginalising the Aborigines. This subject will tell the stories of that transformation, beginning with an account of the ideas and motivations of British authority in the late eighteenth century and concluding at the moment when six British colonies formed a federated nation. Topics to be covered will include: violence, humanitarianism, Christian missions, institutional authority. The course will emphasise and explain regional and temporal differences in the ways that Indigenous and non-Indigenous interacted. Students will study primary sources and learn to understand them in context.
