Academic Handbook Current Edition LANG 2048 Working Grammar Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102414 Coordinator David McInnes Opens in new window Description How does grammar work? And how do languages function in different social contexts? This subject introduces students to a functional analysis of the English language, and relates the structure of English to its use in cultural and social contexts. It offers students of literature and training teachers an introduction to theories and forms of analysis that support much English language education in Australia. The functional model of language is used in a range of fields - including teaching in schools and universities, teaching ESL/EFL, and broader language research. Students will apply the functional analysis of English to a range of spoken and written texts from diverse literary, social and cultural contexts. This will help to provide grammatical skills and work-readiness, especially for students training to be professional teachers.
