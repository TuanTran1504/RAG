Academic Handbook Current Edition HLTH 1001 Foundations of Research and Evidence-Based Practice Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400863 Coordinator Nerida Klupp Opens in new window Description This subject considers the reasons and roles for evidence-based practice and research in healthcare, introducing students to core concepts and relevant terminology. Skills are developed for asking clinical or professional healthcare questions and translating these skills into search strategies for finding evidence. To make sense of that evidence, students are introduced to quantitative and qualitative research methods, types of data, how data are described and how biostatistics is used to provide meaning to research data.
