Academic Handbook Current Edition LAWS 3089 Children’s Rights: Local and International Credit Points 10 Coordinator Meda Couzens Opens in new window Description Children’s Rights: Local and International introduces students to the rights of children at domestic and international level. Students are introduced to the rationale and the development of children’s rights as well as the international and the Australian legal framework for their protection. Amongst the selected topics discussed in more detail are juvenile justice; families and child protection; First Nations children and the law; the exploitation of children; access to justice and governance (domestic and international) and the rights of children. The subject exposes students to multidisciplinary approaches to socio-legal issues and develops their analytical skills to help them conduct research that involves international and comparative legal materials. 

This subject can be taught either in a combination of onshore in Australia and offshore in a host country, or solely onshore in Australia. Students enrolled in the subject with an offshore component must be available to travel for two weeks to the host country.  When no host country is available, this subject may be delivered wholly onshore (in Australia) only.  Students will be advised whether there is an offshore component of study and the availability of a host country in advance of opportunities to enrol.  When delivered offshore in a host country the teaching materials and tutorial activities will incorporate host country-specific issues and activities relevant to the topics covered in the subject.   Offshore delivery integrated with host country specific delivery provides the students with an immersive international and comparative experience, which will enhance their ability critically to engage with Australian and international law relevant to the rights of children.
