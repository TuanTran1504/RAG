Academic Handbook Current Edition ELEC 1004 Electrical Fundamentals (WSTC AssocD) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700104 Coordinator Abbas Ranjbar Opens in new window Description The objective of this subject is to introduce to the student a number of concepts within electrical engineering.  These include basic definitions of charge, current, potential difference, power;  electric circuits and basic laws such as Ohm's and Kirchoff's Laws; Thevenin, Norton's and the maximum power theorems;  electromagnetism and the associated fundamental laws;  capacitor and resistor circuits and time constants;  an introduction to Electronics; communication waves; Logic gates and number systems; and an introduction to Electrical Machines and Renewable Energy systems.  Basic principles are explained and applied to a range of typical electrical circuits and devices. These foundations provide students with the basic requirements for a career in engineering where the concepts can be developed or applied to more complex engineering systems.
