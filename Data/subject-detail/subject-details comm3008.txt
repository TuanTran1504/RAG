The 'open box' approach invites students to develop a concept for a research report or professional project, undertaking preparatory stages of collective and individual research in an area of interest that has emerged as a result of previous studies. Students will generate project options that draw on historical and contemporary research issues and approaches to guide the development of their own research questions and methods specific to their object of research. A range of methodological approaches will be explored, including practice-based methods, industry observation/shadowing, qualitative interviews, and quantitative digital methods. Students will develop their own reading lists, identify appropriate research methods and conduct some pilot testing and evaluation of findings for their project. Students will also learn how to read and consume academic and scholarly research in order to critique problematic issues in published research reports.
