Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 7020 Sustainability and Risk Engineering (PG) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300939 Coordinator Zuhaib Siddiqui Opens in new window Description Analysis of sustainability with engineering perspective is increasingly becoming important in the modern world. Also, in the future sustainability will include risk engineering. Hence, engineers with in-depth understanding of different tools that can be used for both sustainability and risk analysis will have significant competitive edge in their future career. The main objective of this subject is to introduce different tools available for sustainability and risk analysis in various engineering applications. The content includes renewable/alternative energy systems, energy/resource efficiency, sustainable/green buildings, sustainable transport and infrastructure, sustainable water management, environmental management systems, sustainability reporting, life cycle analysis, probability/reliability theory, risk assessment models, overall system analysis.
