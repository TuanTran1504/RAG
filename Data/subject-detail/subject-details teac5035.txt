Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 5035 Science Curriculum 4 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102900 Coordinator Gail Walker Opens in new window Description The subject will explore senior Science curriculum to develop pre-service teachers' pedagogical content knowledge in the teaching of Investigating Science and Science Extension. The subject will provide opportunities to engage with teaching interdisciplinary Science. Emphasis will be placed on principles underlying Investigating Science and Science Extension teaching to develop innovative lesson and subject planning, choose relevant data and contexts to create authentic inquiry project based assessment tasks and apply consistent feedback for student learning. There will be a focus on the development of laboratory skills within the context of Investigating Science and techniques including aspects of general and mandatory safety requirements. Opportunities for investigation and discussion of current research particularly related to the development of applied and inquiry-based Science learning in Science Extension will be explored in depth.

Apply socio-cultural perspectives and pedagogical inquiry theories and approaches used in the Science curriculum area with reference to Investigating Science.
Present well-constructed, innovative and coherent student-centred lessons that include literacy (including key metalanguage) and numeracy, enhance thinking and ICT skills and which take into account the full range of students’ abilities and school-based and system data.
Prepare a suitable range of assessment instruments that use valid, reliable and consistent judgements of student learning.
Design creative and innovative teaching programs that apply an interdisciplinary approach to teaching Science and include opportunities to develop students’ number, spatial, data analysis, problem-solving and graphing skills and understanding.
Use a variety of teaching and learning strategies and apply a variety of laboratory skills and techniques including aspects of general and mandatory safety requirements in the laboratory.
Reflect and research professional learning to develop the discipline of interdisciplinary and extension Science. Subject Content What is the nature of the interdisciplinary science in the senior years of secondary education? 
How are current educational policies and priorities addressed with particular reference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education, literacy and numeracy and ICT, in the teaching of the subject?
