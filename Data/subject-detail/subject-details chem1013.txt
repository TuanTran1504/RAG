Academic Handbook Current Edition CHEM 1013 Essential Chemistry (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700333 Coordinator Grant Boyd Opens in new window Description This subject introduces an investigation of the reactivity of covalent molecules, in particular, of carbon-based compounds. Focussing on introductory chemical dynamics and thermodynamics, you will develop an in-depth understanding of the structure, nomenclature and reactivity of the principal organic functional groups, extending your basic principles of chemistry. You will also understand how molecules are synthesised and the ways they react being important in the function and role of chemistry in biological systems in our domestic and industrial worlds.
