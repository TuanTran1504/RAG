Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 2025 Families and Intimate Life Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102143 Coordinator Emily Wolfinger Opens in new window Description This subject will critically examine sociological perspectives on families and intimate life, building on the approaches and theories introduced in the first year of Sociology studies. The familiarity of families and intimate relationships will be thrown into question. Students will be asked to examine their beliefs, unpack myths of the 'naturalness' of family, and question the 'personal'. Families and intimate relationships will be viewed as part of the wider social structure, their constitutions shaped by culture, economies, social policy, technology and globalisation. The subject will demonstrate the historical and cultural specificity of the nuclear family and its role in the creation and reproduction of social inequality and social difference.
