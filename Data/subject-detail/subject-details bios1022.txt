Academic Handbook Current Edition BIOS 1022 Introduction to Human Biology Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300361 Coordinator Srinivas Nammi Opens in new window Description This subject gives a basic understanding of the human body and introduces the scientific and medical terminology used for anatomy, physiology and biochemistry. It deals with gross structure and microscopic structure of the human body. It also examines microbial organisms, their classification, how they differ from eukaryotic cells and how our body defends against them. Where appropriate, examples of functional diseases will be discussed. School Science Discipline Human Biology Student Contribution Band HECS Band 2 10cp Check your fees via the Fees page.
