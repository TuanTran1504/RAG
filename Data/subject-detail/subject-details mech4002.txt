Academic Handbook Current Edition MECH 4002 Computer Aided Engineering Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301000 Coordinator Leo Zhang Opens in new window Description This subject describes the basics and fundamentals of computer aided engineering focusing on the advanced topics of finite element methods, which is a powerful numerical tool for analysing a wide range of engineering problems. Through applied projects students will apply the finite element method (FEM)-based computer aided engineering (CAE) and its applications in the fields of solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and heat transfer and product design and development as well. The development of students' academic skills in research and communication are also achieved through the completion of FEM-based CAE projects.
