Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 6001 Introduction to Neuroscience Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401471 Coordinator Yossi Buskila Opens in new window Description This subject is an introduction to the nervous system with a focus on its role and the function. It provides a strong foundation in modern neuroscience for those wishing to apply the principles of sensory and motor system function with the aim of mimicking human biology via neuromorphic implementations. Students will have access to expertise from a multidisciplinary team, guiding their learning in the areas of cellular, computational, behavioural and biomedical neuroscience. Topics covered in the subject will include introductory biology, structure and function of the nervous system, computational modelling, bio-signal acquisition and signal processing.
