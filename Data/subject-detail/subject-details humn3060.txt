Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 3060 Modern Japanese History Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 100271 Coordinator Peter Mauch Opens in new window Description This subject considers Japan's trajectory from the battle of Sekigahara in 1600 until the atomic bombings in 1945. We will examine the samurai and ritual suicide, the tea ceremony and Zen Buddhism. We will read tales told by those who frequented the "floating world," populated by wealthy merchants, geisha, and sumo wrestlers. We will consider the creation of Imperial Japan, and we will study its emergence as the only non-Western Great Power. We will enquire into Japan's fledgling democracy in the 1920s, and its descent into militarism and aggression in the 1930s. Finally, we will consider Japan's participation in World War II: its victories, its losses, its propaganda, and its abject defeat.
