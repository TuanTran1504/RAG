Basic concepts introduced and applied include: national income accounting, economic structure, price indexes and inflation, the balance of payments, and labour market aggregates.  These concepts are applied in describing and explaining the recent evolution of the Australian economy in terms of growth, structural change, price stability, and employment.  This leads to a discussion of major policy issues such as the role of governments in managing economic fluctuations, and the implications of Australia's foreign liabilities.
