Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 7151 Applied Mathematics and Science in Secondary STEM Education Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102764 Coordinator Gail Walker Opens in new window Description This subject develops in-service teachers' knowledge and skills in the application of mathematics and science in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines. The subject content and assessments are designed to (1) build teachers' foundational skills in science/mathematics, and (2) build teachers' professional skills in the implementation of science/mathematics in their classrooms. A particular focus of the subject is how science/mathematics can be used to authentically integrate curriculum content from across the different STEM disciplines through inquiry- and problem-based learning, with the ultimate aim of enhancing student engagement and achievement in the STEM disciplines.
