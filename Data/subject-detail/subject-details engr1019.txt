Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 1019 Fundamentals of Mechanics (WSTC AssocD) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700113 Coordinator Abbas Ranjbar Opens in new window Description This subject deals with the action and interaction of forces, moments and couples in two and three dimensions.  It examines the equilibrium of single bodies, and of trusses and mechanisms.  It then looks at the friction between bodies.  It covers the dynamics of a non-rotating body, and a body rotating about a fixed axis.  Finally, internal loadings are investigated - particularly within a transversely loaded beam.  The subject makes extensive use of vector algebra.
