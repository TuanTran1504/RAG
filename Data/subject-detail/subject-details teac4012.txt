Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 4012 Teaching EAL/D Students in the Primary Years Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102799 Coordinator Pegah Marandi Opens in new window Description The 2016 ABS Census reveals that Australia is a 'fast changing, ever expanding culturally diverse nation'. One in four Australian children come from language backgrounds other than English including children born in Australia and immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers arriving in Australia each year. Many of these students will require English language learning support in the classroom. This support will vary depending on learner needs and language proficiency. The focus of this subject is to provide initial education teachers with a foundation of theoretical principles related to teaching and learning English. The emphasis will be on developing an understanding of appropriate classroom strategies within a mainstream, cross-curricula program, for learners of English as a second language including appropriate pedagogies for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. This subject is included in the Transition Phase of the Bachelor of Education.
