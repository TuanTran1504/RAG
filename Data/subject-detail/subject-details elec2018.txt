This subject reinforces the understanding of discrete mathematics and the role it plays in computing science and engineering. Students learn how to systematically derive implementations from formal specifications using simple mathematics. Students also learn to develop an understanding of the rules for deriving implementations from specifications. Why do they work? What do we have to prove and how? This is crucial for later industrial software engineering practice.
