Academic Handbook Current Edition MATH 1001 Analysis of Change Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300830 Coordinator Rehez Ahlip Opens in new window Description This Level 1 subject introduces students to the mathematical modelling techniques that are used to formulate and solve problems in the physical and biological sciences. To use these techniques successfully, students must develop the ability to formulate a problem mathematically and then be able to use the appropriate knowledge to test conclusions by analytical and numerical means. These skills will be emphasized as each technique in introduced. Apart from some introductory work on logarithms and exponentials (essential concepts in the sciences), the main techniques developed involve aspects of differential calculus, culminating in the use of differential equations to model real phenomena in the sciences.

Level Undergraduate Level 1 subject Equivalent Subjects MATH 1011 - Fundamentals of Mathematics LGYB 0484 - Analysis of Change (WSTC) Incompatible Subjects MATH 1014 - Mathematics 1A Restrictions Students may complete the three subjects Quantitative Thinking, Analysis of Change and Maths 1A in the following order: 300831 Quantitative Thinking, 300830 Analysis of Change, 300672 Mathematics 1A. This means that students may complete 300831 before attempting 300830, but not after. 300830 and 300831 may be attempted before 300672, but not after. Students may not enrol in 300831 and 300830 or 300831 and 300672 or 300830 and 300672 in the same teaching session. Students enrolled in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours), Bachelor of Engineering or Bachelor of Engineering Science may not enrol in any of the subjects 300830, 300831 or 300672. Assumed Knowledge General Mathematics background achieved at bands 5 or 6, or Mathematics, achieved at band 4, or equivalent or 300831 Quantitative Thinking.
