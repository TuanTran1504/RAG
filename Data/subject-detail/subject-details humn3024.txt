Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 3024 Comparative Nationalism Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102003 Coordinator Margarite Poulos Opens in new window Description Nationalism, an ideology considered by many to have passed its peak, now dominates world politics and permeates political discourse. This phenomenon is crucial to understanding Trump's America First campaign, the problems affecting the EU and secession, the tensions and conflicts that are garbed in a religious rhetorical veil, and which constitute much of the agenda of today's "war on terror." What is nationalism? What is national identity? What are the main forms of its articulation in history and in the present, across geographical borders, class boundaries, gender and generational cleavages?  This subject will survey the major theories of nationalism, and examine diverse examples of historical and contemporary nationalisms, predominantly within the European context. This is an upper level subject whose readings draw on a variety of approaches and examples and aim at providing a solid introduction to the scholarly literature.
