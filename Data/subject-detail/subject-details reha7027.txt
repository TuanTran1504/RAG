Academic Handbook Current Edition REHA 7027 Research into Practice: bridging the clinician-researcher divide in applied and creative therapies Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102728 Coordinator Alison Short Opens in new window Description Evidence Based Research (EBR) can inform excellence in clinical practice in order to best meet the needs of our clients and patients. How we choose and use this research is critical, as is the way that we understand ourselves to be a researcher, beyond our practitioner identity. If you are seeking to translate benchtop research (basic laboratory approaches) into applied research practice, and if you are transitioning towards a new identity as a clinician-researcher, this is the subject for you. Our applied research focus considers broad applications relevant to the creative arts therapies, verbal therapies, allied and other health professions, by looking at research processes which ultimately improve practice in the 'real world'.
