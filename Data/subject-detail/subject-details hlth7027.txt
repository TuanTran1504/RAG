Academic Handbook Current Edition HLTH 7027 Professional Project in Health 1 Credit Points 20 Legacy Code 401369 Coordinator Evan Atlantis Opens in new window Description Health professionals, particularly those at managerial positions, are frequently tasked with solving very complex problems in their practice. Some of these problems are so complex that they can be called 'wicked' problems, or problems that are highly resistant to resolution. This subject uses project-based learning to provide students with the opportunity to work collaboratively and inter-disciplinarily to solve an industry-driven 'wicked' problem, using systematic and evidence-based techniques to do so. Students will be challenged to think broadly to take into account the interrelationships among a full range of causal factors underlying the 'wicked' problem at hand, and will be required to use more collaborative and innovative approaches to solve industry challenges. Students will be exposed to a range of industry representatives who will pose the difficult, 'wicked' problems to them and who will return to assess the proposed solutions.
