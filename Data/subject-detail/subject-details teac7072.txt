Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 7072 Managing Challenging and Diverse Behaviour Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102151 Coordinator Christine Grima-Farrell Opens in new window Description This subject provides professionals with the skills to successfully and systemically manage challenging behaviours exhibited by individuals in classrooms, early childhood, or other educational settings. This subject will focus on managing critical features of the environment to encourage positive behaviours and prevent challenging behaviours from occurring. Intervention strategies are also developed to address significant negative behavioural challenges when preventative measures are ineffective. Professionals will develop competencies in identifying and analysing problem behaviours and designing suitable management plans. Such skills will be helpful to either professionals working directly with individuals with additional needs, or as consultants supporting those who provide direct support to individuals with challenging and diverse behaviours.
