Academic Handbook Current Edition ARCH 3005 Architecture Studio - The Infrastructural Credit Points 20 Legacy Code 301202 Coordinator Vesna Trobec Opens in new window Description This subject situates learning in the context of the major urban public projects that sit at the intersection of architecture, infrastructure, and urban design and which highlight the pressure of population growth, climate change, or other significant demographic, economic, political, or ecological transformations. Work integrated learning is a key feature of the Rethinking Infrastructure studio which involve relevant members of the professional community to help lead studio investigations and/or embed students in professional practices. Projects  include architectural responses to complex urban and infrastructural projects at a large scale  such as transit oriented development, high density housing, landscape urbanism. Students develop professional practice skills on these real world projects and incorporate sustainable strategies of design as well as learning skills in advocacy, entrepreneurship, and professional readiness.

Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Analyse and evaluate cities and urban form, morphology, systems, ecologies, and interactivity between urban conditions, to inform design solutions that address scenarios of urban complexity and civic or infrastructural scale.
Apply an advanced level of theoretical and technical awareness in architectural and spatial design with an ability to explore and propose a variety of sensitive design solutions through the language of architectural representation in section, plan and models using both analogue and digital techniques.
Demonstrate an awareness of the broader cultural context in which architecture is practised, through the application of local and regional planning considerations and an understanding of the history and practice of urban design.
Understand and apply strategies for climatically responsive, equitable, humane, resilient, and robust design solutions for urban environments.
Generate technical and analytical drawings and reports using graphic and modelling skills to convey a design proposal.
Develop an awareness of the architect�fs professional, regulatory, and administrative roles, the business and entrepreneurial aspects of practice, and alternate roles of engagement.
