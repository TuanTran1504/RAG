Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 2025 Introduction to Data Science Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301486 Coordinator Liwan Liyanage Opens in new window Description Analysis of data is essential for scientific investigation, modelling processes and predicting future events. Data Science is the investigation of the tools required that allow us to perform this modelling and prediction. The increase in accessible data over the past few decades has promoted the use of Data Science, making it a desired skill in many professions. In this subject we further investigate the methods of regression, clustering and classification that form the basis of a data scientist's toolbox.
