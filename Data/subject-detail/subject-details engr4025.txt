Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 4025 Final Year Project 1 (UG Engineering) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301245 Coordinator Ee Loon Tan Opens in new window Description This subject describes engineering as a profession, highlighting professional ethics and legal obligations. The focus will be on the development of design skills or research and presentation skills for students enrolled in this subject. This will be achieved through the use of appropriate design/research skills on a capstone project, which will be either design oriented or research oriented on a specialist topic. Under the direction of an academic supervisor and research mentor, the project will demonstrate the student's professional level of identifying, planning, and designing an engineering project while at the same time completing a technical progress report. The capstone project will be continued in the subject Final Year Project 2 (UG Engineering).
