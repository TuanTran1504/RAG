Academic Handbook Current Edition MATH 3012 Combinatorics Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301378 Coordinator Leanne Rylands Opens in new window Description This subject builds upon the knowledge acquired in the prerequisite subject Discrete Mathematics and helps students to develop understanding and mathematical maturity. The subject covers more sophisticated counting techniques, additional concepts in graph theory, and it introduces coding theory. Many applications of these concepts are included, and some combinatorial algorithms are studied. The applications and techniques presented in the subject are used to model systems such as transport networks and social networks, and they have relevance for communication, computing, probability, statistics, and science, and for many everyday problems such as scheduling.
