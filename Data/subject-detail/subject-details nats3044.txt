Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 3044 Complex Case Studies in Science Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301261 Coordinator Julie Old Opens in new window Description Science and the scientific process of discovery have been successful in offering explanations for the world we live in. Even seemingly simple problems can disguise a far greater degree of complexity. Indeed, the more we develop our tools for scientific discovery the greater the degree of complexity that is revealed. Exploring and unravelling the complexity of the world we live in requires integrative and multidisciplinary research frameworks, and it can be complicated further by the relationship between science and society, culturally, socially, economically and politically. In this subject we will begin the life-long journey to develop the enquiring scientific mind by exploring the complexities of seemingly innocuous everyday elements.   Students will critically examine such perspectives in a series of contemporary 'real-life' case studies such as foods and food security, medicines and drugs.
