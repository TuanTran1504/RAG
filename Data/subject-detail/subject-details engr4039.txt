Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 4039 Design for Advanced Manufacturing Credit Points 10 Coordinator Richard Yang Opens in new window Description This subject develops specific knowledge and skills in Design for Advanced Manufacturing technologies in the context of Industry 4.0 and Advanced Manufacturing. Advanced manufacturing represents state-of-the-art and cutting-edge manufacturing technologies and processes for high-quality and high precision production of materials and products. Throughout this subject, students will learn advanced manufacturing technologies and processes that lead to the transformation of materials and products into intelligent, sustainable, eco-friendly, and environmentally-conscious practices. Moreover, students will develop the ability to discern suitable practices, materials, and manufacturing processes, as well as analyse the outcomes of Advanced Manufacturing, with a focus on sustainability, efficiency, safety, and ethical considerations, all in the context of their application to the WSU Formula SAE Car Project. Upon successful completion of this subject, students can explore a range of career avenues, including roles such as Manufacturing Engineer, Product Designer, CAD/CAM Engineer, Materials Engineer, and related opportunities.
