Academic Handbook Current Edition INFS 1007 Systems Analysis and Design (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700013 Coordinator Buddhima De Silva Opens in new window Description This subject introduces the concepts of System Analysis and Design. The study of methodologies and techniques for problem recognition, requirement analysis, process modelling and/or data modelling are essential elements of this subject. The Systems Development Life Cycle model is employed as the prime approach to teach the subject, providing students with the basic skills required for analysis and design of logical solutions to information systems problems. The use of Computer Aided System Engineering tools will be discussed in practical sessions.
