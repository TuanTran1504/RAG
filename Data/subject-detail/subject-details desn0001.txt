This subject investigates how the design process is applied to real-world industry design briefs to create a visual design. Students develop an understanding of the processes and practices used to support collaboration between clients, designers and specialists when designing and producing visual communications. Students are guided through the process of interpreting a design brief, creating and pitching a design response, presenting work for critique, incorporating critique into a design solution and producing highly refined design outcomes to a professional standard.  Students work on a number of design briefs using industry standard work practices, including time management strategies, multi-tasking, strict delivery deadlines, brief comprehension and job documentation as well as client/designer coordination and negotiation.
