It challenges students to critically examine the relationships through which personal and social knowledge is constructed and their efficacy in the construction of learning for the future. Inherent in such thinking are questions about the processes of change in education systems that lead through equity, inclusiveness, wellbeing, social justice and ecological sustainability.
