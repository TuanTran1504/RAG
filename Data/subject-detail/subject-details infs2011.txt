Academic Handbook Current Edition INFS 2011 Object Oriented Analysis (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Coordinator Buddhima De Silva Opens in new window Description The core strength of this subject is to analyse and model business objectives and critical requirements of software systems to be developed using object-oriented (OO) approaches. The system analysis is taken to greater depths within the context of object orientation.  The Unified Modelling Language version 2.0 (notably use cases, activity diagrams, class diagrams and sequence diagrams) is used as a modelling standard for creating OO models in the problem space.  The subject also covers the rational unified process methodology and applications of design patterns for software development through practical case studies.

- basic problem solving experience in computerised information systems
- ability to derive systems requirements from problem definitions
- ability to produce system models using process, data, object and network modelling.
- understanding design and implementation issues include, (but may not be limited to), elementary database design, input, output and user interface design and prototyping.
