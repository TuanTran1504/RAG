This subject introduces students to issues, principles and frameworks associated with exploring opportunities and challenges that relate to these three activities. Emerging and new markets are examples of markets that represent opportunities and challenges for innovation and entrepreneurial activities. Through selected readings that emphasise key themes and issues, students will be exposed to an understanding of what constitutes entrepreneurship, innovation, new markets and market development, how they are influenced by the ever-changing business environment, an examination of opportunities that emerge as a result of changing technology and consumer expectations taking place in emerging and new markets. Emerging markets have become a key source of innovation in products, services and business processes which calls for an examination as to whether these can be extended to developed markets. The subject provides students with an opportunity for continuous practical experiential learning through collaboration with industry Launch Pad partners.
