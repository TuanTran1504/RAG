Academic Handbook Current Edition HLTH 2031 Motor Behaviour Credit Points 10 Coordinator Kylie Steel Opens in new window Description Motor Behaviour is an investigation of the physiological and psychological processes involved in both the control and the learning of movement. As such, it considers the control mechanisms which are innate to the learner, how these mechanisms change by virtue of both maturation and experience, and how the latter type of changes may be facilitated by manipulation of the learning environment.
