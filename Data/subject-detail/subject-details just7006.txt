Academic Handbook Current Edition JUST 7006 Legal Internship Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 201064 Coordinator Zaky Orya Opens in new window Description This subject provides an internship opportunity for Juris Doctor students to be placed in host organisations (including NGOs and public interest organisations, community legal centres, government departments, corporations, barristers' chambers or private law firms). 
Internships provide students with invaluable access to opportunities to critically analyse the law in context, to apply their formal learning about legal principles, to demonstrate professional skills and to gain exposure to different career pathways. 
Students who successfully complete the orientation requirements will spend twelve days throughout the semester at a host organisation. This will usually be done on a one- day (7 hours) per week basis.
An intern's duties will generally consist of a combination of substantive tasks relating to law, policy and practice. Depending on the host organisation, these may include a combination of research, preparing background materials, briefing papers or research reports, liaising with other organisations, assisting in the provision of legal assistance and advice, observing interviews with clients, conferences with Counsel or in court proceedings, undertaking project and advocacy work, preparing/ giving presentations and assisting with administrative and editing work. 
The School will seek expressions of interest for the number of placements available with the School's partner host organisations each semester. 
Students are also able to arrange their own internships at organisations that are not currently host organisations, subject to the approval of the Director / Principal Solicitor and the agreement of the host organisation to complete the attendance and assessment requirements of the subject.
