Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 2024 Integrated Science (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700096 Coordinator Virginia Shepherd Opens in new window Description Science and the scientific process of discovery have been successful in offering explanations for the world we live in.  Due to scientific advances, we have eradicated some disease, explored the moon and the deepest parts of our oceans and created communication across distances on the planet previously unimaginable. We now face the major challenge of creating a future world which is sustainable for life on Earth.  Solving our contemporary complex human and environmental issues to create a sustainable future, however, requires integrative and multidisciplinary research frameworks, an understanding of the relationship between science and society including cultural, social, economic, political and ethical factors.  Students will critically examine such perspectives in a series of contemporary 'real-life' case studies such as climate change, indigenous health, medical breakthroughs, biodiversity loss, environmental sustainability and human-animal interactions.  They will undertake research into the relationship of science integrated with society, and the uncertainty and bias of evidence in decision making.  They will demonstrate their understanding by analysis of a contemporary issue by producing a scientific report and a powerpoint or video.
