Academic Handbook Current Edition MEDI 7003 Allergic Sciences 2 Credit Points 20 Legacy Code 401250 Coordinator Miriam Codarini Opens in new window Description This subject will consist of four online modules dealing with the immunological and clinical aspects of allergic diseases.  These modules will cover fundamental theoretical and clinical concepts underlying Food Allergy, Allergic Airways Diseases, and Rhinoconjunctivitis, Sinusitis and Immunotherapy.  The purpose of Allergic Sciences 2 is to complement Allergic Sciences 1 and provide students with comprehensive knowledge for managing patients with allergic conditions in clinical practice.  Students will use self directed learning to link basic science with clinical understanding, and must attend a written exam at a university approved venue for one of the assessments.

Students must be qualified and registered medical practitioners. Assumed Knowledge Students must have completed a medical degree (MBBS, MBChB or equivalent qualification) and preferably have a basic understanding of core immunological concepts and previous clinical experience. Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Examine the immune mechanisms involved in allergic disease pathogenesis and implications for diagnosis and treatment.
Examine the pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation and treatment of food allergy and respiratory allergy.
Consider key aspects of the professional practice required of doctors caring for patients with food allergy and respiratory allergy, including their limitations and referral pathways for complex patients.
Apply critical thinking to assess and manage patients with food allergy and respiratory allergy.
Acquire evidence based knowledge that informs best clinical allergy practice via online self-directed learning strategies. Subject Content This subject consists of four modules covering:
1. Food Allergy ? IgE Mediated
2. Food Allergy ? Non IgE Mediated
3. Allergic Airways Disease
4. Rhinoconjunctivitis, Sinusitis and Immunotherapy
These modules link basic science with clinical aspects of specific allergic diseases to provide students with clinically relevant knowledge. The learning materials will enable students in the Graduate Diploma in Allergic Diseases (exit only) and Master of Medicine (Allergic Diseases) to undertake the required clinical experiences.
