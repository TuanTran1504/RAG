Academic Handbook Current Edition REHA 3046 Optimising Mealtimes Across the Lifespan Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401424 Coordinator Rebecca Smith Opens in new window Description This subject discusses theoretical and evidence-based approaches to assessment and management of a diverse range of swallowing disorders in infants, children and adults. Students will have opportunities to interpret and synthesise assessment findings and create management plans to optimise mealtime experiences by exploring cases that address the needs of individuals with swallowing disorders, their families and communities. Students will plan and implement core speech pathology assessment and therapy skills, related to swallowing and mealtime management through observation and practice. Evidence-based, interdisciplinary and holistic approaches to swallowing and mealtime management will be integrated during this subject.

REHA 2016 Restrictions Students must be enrolled in the 4763 Bachelor of Speech Pathology or 4764 Bachelor of Speech Pathology (Honours) Assumed Knowledge Students are expected to have acquired introductory knowledge and skills in speech pathology practice before undertaking this subject. Students will be expected to have knowledge of the anatomical, neurological, physiological, cognitive, and perceptual bases of swallowing and mealtimes and understand typical and atypical development and changes  in swallowing function across the lifespan. Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Integrate knowledge of core anatomical, physiological and neurological factors that impact swallowing development and functioning, with clinical information, to formulate appropriate assessment approaches for infants, children and adults.
Synthesise and analyse case information, clinical and instrumental assessment data, to inform swallowing diagnosis and prognosis for individuals presenting with a swallowing disorder
Implement principles of Evidence-based Practice (EBP) and knowledge of the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) Framework to develop well-reasoned mealtime management plans with individuals, families and carers
Conduct an independent Oral-Motor Assessment,(OMA) within a structured clinical setting, at developing level competency.
Employ interdisciplinary communication and model swallowing and management strategies within a structured clinical setting, at developing level of competence
Critically reflect on the ethical and legal responsibilities of speech pathologists working with individuals who have swallowing disorders Subject Content Anatomy, physiology and neurology of swallowing in infants, children and adults 
Clinical (e.g., protocols, screening) and instrumental (e.g. Video Fluroscopic Swallowing Study, Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallow) approaches to swallowing assessment 
Applying theoretical frameworks (e.g., International Classification of Functioning, Disability & Health) and evidence-based approaches to identify and manage issues involving each phase of swallowing to facilitate safe, enjoyable mealtimes 
Clinical decision making to inform diagnosis, prognosis and management for intervention for infants, children and adults with diverse swallowing disorders 
Planning evidence-based intervention for children and adults with swallowing disorders including oral hygiene, dentition, saliva management, sensory issues, compensatory and rehabilitation strategies, and non-oral nutrition and hydration 
Interprofessional team approaches to enhance swallowing and mealtime experiences for children and adults 
Responsive mealtime management of children and adults with complex clinical, psychosocial and environmental issues Special Requirements Legislative pre-requisites First Aid Certificate.
