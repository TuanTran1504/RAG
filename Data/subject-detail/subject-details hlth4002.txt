Academic Handbook Current Edition HLTH 4002 Evidence-Based Practice (Advanced) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400944 Coordinator Rosalind Bye Opens in new window Description In this subject, students incorporate previous research and biostatistics knowledge to develop new skills for using evidence to inform all aspects of their professional practice. Evidence-based practice uses an enquiry led approach to manage expanding and uncertain knowledge by formulating answerable questions, effectively searching literature, critically appraising evidence validity and results, and to assess its significance in clinical practice and healthcare decision-making. Students will incorporate evidence in communication and shared decision-making processes for patient scenarios relevant to their program. Students will embark on research training through studying the theory and application of research methods to honours research in their chosen field and practising the skills to analyse evidence in the health sciences.
