Academic Handbook Current Edition LAWS 7066 Professional Responsibility and Legal Ethics Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 201049 Coordinator Michael Brogan Opens in new window Description This subject provides students with the opportunity to critically reflect on the legal, statutory and ethical principles and standards that underpin the professional obligations of legal practitioners. Students will also analyse ethical issues that commonly occur in professional legal practice in contemporary multicultural Australia, particularly with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It deals with the professional, legal and ethical responsibilities legal practitioners owe to the law, the courts, their clients and to fellow practitioners, as well as the state and society at large. Students will be able to explain and evaluate the law and practice of legal practitioners, by reference to key topics, such as: professionalism; legal ethics; the history, structure and regulation of the legal profession; and the interpersonal, psychological and cultural factors affecting lawyering.  Guided by an ethical decision-making model, students will demonstrate their ability to use primary legal materials to answer legal ethical problems, and explore the relationship between personal and professional attitudes and values by reflecting on their own views and observations.
