Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 3069 Queer Culture Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102191 Coordinator David McInnes Opens in new window Description Queer culture will introduce students to queer theory and provide opportunities to use these theories in the close study of cultural practice and politics. Queer theory counters the idea that people have stable sexes, genders and sexualities. Instead, queer theory argues that the experience of those that are homosexual, bisexual, transgender, and intersex highlight the frequent mis-matches in what are taken for granted to be 'normal' experiences of identity. Queer theory demonstrates the impossibility of a natural or normal sexuality, but it also demonstrates the problem with the terms 'man' and 'woman', 'male' and 'female', 'normal' and 'abnormal'. In Queer culture students will learn about queer theories and have the opportunity to apply these theories to an in-depth and personally engaging study of queer politics and activism; queer media, film and performance; and queer sex, selfhood, and identity trans/formations.
