Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 5001 Fire Engineering 1 (Fire Dynamics) Credit Points 10 Coordinator Sameera Wijesiri Pathirana Opens in new window Description This subject is essential for anyone considering a career in Fire Safety and aims to develop detailed knowledge of fire behaviour and dynamics in the built environment. Students will better understand fuels and combustion processes, the chemistry of combustion, flammability limits, ignition characteristics and different types of flames and fire plumes. The subject also introduces students to the basic principles of fire safety design so that they can appreciate fire safety and develop appropriate fire safety engineering solutions.
