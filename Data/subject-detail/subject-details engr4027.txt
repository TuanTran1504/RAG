Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 4027 Industrial Design Applied Research Project (Honours) Credit Points 20 Legacy Code 301299 Coordinator Mauricio Novoa Opens in new window Description The Industrial Design Honours Program provides candidates with an opportunity to undertake a significant design research project and research training component that explores design issues including products, services, systems and research methods. In this subject students combine scholarly inquiry, critical thinking, design thinking, applied design research methods and exploratory prototyping informed by state of the art research via literature review, and human-centred design methods with ethical considerations. Discussion of results of preliminary concept explorations of low to medium fidelity are further refined towards a reframed and detailed design brief, research project timeline, and evolved design research methodology in preparation for a high quality research proposal and a substantial creative work.
