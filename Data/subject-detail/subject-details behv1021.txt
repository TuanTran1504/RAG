These perspectives are further understood through application of the 'levels of analysis' framework.  The content then moves on to social psychology and covers topics such as: self and identity, attitudes and attitude change, conformity and obedience, prejudice and discrimination, aggression, pro-social behaviour and attraction and close relationships. Students explore the relevance of these topics to everyday life and contemporary issues.
