Academic Handbook Current Edition PERF 3030 Performing as a Professional Musician Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102859 Coordinator John Encarnacao Opens in new window Description Performance as a Professional Musician builds upon preceding subjects in the Performance sub-major to equip students for performance opportunities in real-world environments. Subject matter canvassed includes arrangement and interpretation, real-world writing about performance, stagecraft and event production. With the guidance of the subject coordinator/tutors, vetted through a professional project proposal process, students will prepare and mount a 30-minute performance project as featured performer. The type of repertoire, instrumentation and personnel will be up to the student and will reflect acquired strengths and aspirations. Through a workshop process, students will be encouraged to refine their performance and to further develop their capacity to give colleagues measured and constructive feedback. Short written tasks reflect real-world expectations of the professional musician in the form of project proposal, program note and festival pitch.
