Academic Handbook Current Edition PUBH 3024 Harm Minimisation and Prevention Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401387 Coordinator Catharine Fleming Opens in new window Description Injury and harm have been recognised as contributing factors to the Global and Australian Burden of Disease and Injury and have been identified as a National Health Priority in Australia. To effectively measure the impact of injury and harm, and develop prevention strategies, insight and understanding of the causes, risk factors, Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) must be taken into consideration. Evidence-based approaches to injury prevention and harm minimisation must be applied and effectively communicated to stakeholders of differing capacities and viewpoints. This subject utilises injury prevention and harm minimisation theory, case-based and project-based learning to challenge future public health leaders to develop effective injury prevention and harm minimisation strategies and also to communicate their message effectively, navigating the complexities of differing worldviews and stakeholder responsibilities.
