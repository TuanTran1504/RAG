Academic Handbook Current Edition MATH 3007 Predictive Modelling Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301034 Coordinator Yi Guo Opens in new window Description In this information age, business and science depend on accurate predictions to make informed decisions. Machine learning is the process of allowing a computer to learn from data, which at its heart is used in making these important decisions.  This unit provides students with the knowledge and practice required to implement and effectively use these predictive models such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. Students will use the Python programming language throughout this unit.
