This subject introduces students to how plants grow and interact with their environment. Students will learn how leaves turn sunlight energy into sugars; stems transport water, solutes and organic compounds; roots acquire water and mineral nutrients by themselves or in association with soil microbes; and hormones regulate plant development and responses to the environment. This knowledge set is crucial for managing our Century's key challenges of food security and climate change. Students will be required to travel to the Hawkesbury campus where the practicals take place.
