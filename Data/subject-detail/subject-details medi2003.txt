Small group problem based learning, bedside teaching with patients and procedural skills teaching scaffolded by lectures, tutorials and practicals cover each of the body systems in turn, so that students are well prepared for clinical learning. Students will also learn about the human context of health and disease, medical professionalism, the quality and safety of healthcare, evidence based practice, research and clinical skills through community visits, hospital based-sessions and workshops. The Professional Portfolio component within this subject will provide students in the Doctor of Medicine (MD) program with the means to monitor and support their acquisition of professional competencies in medicine. Supported by teaching sessions, learning resources and Professional Advisors, students will collate and review evidence of their learning, such as clinical assessments and case studies, preparatory work and outcomes from research and scholarly projects. By identifying and addressing their learning and professional development needs, students will create their own personalised learning journey as the basis for life-long learning in medicine. The Professional Portfolio will also prepare students for the portfolios used extensively in post graduate specialty training in medicine.
