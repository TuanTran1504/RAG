Student groups act as a Board of Directors to plan, communicate, execute, and adjust strategy as they pursue to optimise their firm's outcomes in an online competitive game. Knowledge areas of staffing, finance, labour management, risk management and tendering are challenged. Each week, student groups are scored objectively and given feedback. This shows the team the strengths and weaknesses of the prior week's decision making. Academic staff will work with each student group to refine and improve understanding of the complex dynamics involved. Assessments will be based on decision-making improvement and mastery of strategic and operational principles.
