Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 7017 Ecopedagogies Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102157 Coordinator Tonia Gray Opens in new window Description In simplest terms, ecopedagogies is teaching and learning in partnership with Nature. This interdisciplinary subject examines place-based theory and outdoor-experiential education. Research has repeatedly shown that outdoor experiential learning promotes health, well-being, cognitive advancement, growth and development for children, youth and adults. Correspondingly, the importance of ecopedagogies in this historical era cannot be underestimated. The precariousness of human/nature interrelationships compels us to explore new ways of learning and knowing and ecopedagogies provides new ways of connecting with the natural world. Further insight is gained through engaging with First Peoples' knowledge systems through the conceptualisation of 'country' and relational frameworks.
