Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 3102 Social Sciences International Placement (III): Post-placement Reflections Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102725 Coordinator Peta Hinton Opens in new window Description This subject is the final component of the Social Sciences International Placement.  Facilitated by the subject coordinators the subject comprises a series of workshops and assessments, which will provide opportunities for students to debrief and reflect critically on their placement experience.  Assessments and workshops are designed so that students learn how to convey newly acquired skills, perspectives and life choices in different settings (classroom; job interviews and applications), and to apply the placement experience in immediate and life-long educational, professional and personal endeavours. For those students who have undertaken a placement overseas, the subject is also designed to encourage reintegration into their home culture. Specifically, assessments and workshops are designed so that students intentionally process and analyse the layered meanings of their time spent abroad, and the feelings and experiences of coming 'home'.
