Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 1029 Human Rights, Peace and Development (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700158 Coordinator Mona Shrestha Opens in new window Description The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was written in response to the atrocities of World War II. Since its ratification, the UDHR has been a "roadmap" for peace, forming the basis for international responses to conflicts, poverty and disadvantage. This subject examines and critiques the concept of human rights. It will be shown how differentials of political and economic power between countries and groups within countries are used to prioritise and preference different rights so as to justify selective humanitarian efforts in the initial phases of peace-making and the policy requirements for peace-building in human social, economic and cultural development.
