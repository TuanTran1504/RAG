Academic Handbook Current Edition NURS 7009 Child and Family Health Practice: Supporting Growth and Development Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400972 Coordinator Christine Taylor Opens in new window Description This subject provides the student with knowledge of the theories of child development and the foundational knowledge and skills to be applied in the screening, surveillance and promotion of health and well-being of young children and families. This includes current immunisation schedules and use of evidence-based developmental screening tools. Content will focus on the normal physical, social and emotional growth and development of young children (0-5 years). The importance of the early years in brain development including infant-parent attachment will be linked to an exploration of child behaviour, sleep and settling, play and safety issues. The child and family health nurses' role in supporting families experiencing infant sleep and settling difficulties and behaviour problems will be addressed. The knowledge gained in this subject will be consolidated through virtual clinical placement. School Nursing & Midwifery Student Contribution Band HECS Band 1 10cp Check your fees via the Fees page.
