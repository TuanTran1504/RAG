Academic Handbook Current Edition HLTH 7001 A Global Perspective on Social Determinants of Health Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400841 Coordinator Evan Atlantis Opens in new window Description Evidence is mounting that the health of individuals, groups and whole populations is significantly determined by social factors - the social determinants. The related research has its origins in concern for the growing inequalities in health both within and between countries. This subject examines the framework of the social determinants of health in a global perspective and includes a reflection on the phenomenon of globalisation and its impact, both positive and negative on people's health. Students will critically reflect on this relatively new and emerging body of knowledge and research which clearly situates the maintenance of health and healthy societies within their socioeconomic and socio-cultural contexts. They will also examine implications for policy, health systems and different groups within society. School Health Sciences Discipline Health, Not Elsewhere Classified.
