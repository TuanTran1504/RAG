Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 2011 Graphics 2:  Visual Simulation Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301076 Coordinator Chris Nash Opens in new window Description From 2020, this subject will be replaced by 301287 - Designing Graphics: Engineering Documentation.      Three-dimensional digital simulations are used to model manufactured artefacts, create virtual environments and simulate dynamic processes or systems. In this subject students will use 3D modelling software to simulate static and dynamic 3D structures. High quality photorealistic rendering and 3D printing file preparation will also be covered.
