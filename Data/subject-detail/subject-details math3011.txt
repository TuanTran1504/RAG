Academic Handbook Current Edition MATH 3011 Probabilistic Models and Inference Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301250 Coordinator Oliver Obst Opens in new window Description The subject provides students with an understanding of probabilistic models and inference. It covers model-based approaches for complex systems - from constructing these models to applying information to models. The models, which can be created manually and obtained by learning from data, will also be useful to make decisions under uncertainty. A variety of models and techniques will be discussed; examples include Monte Carlo Methods, Decision Theory, Bayesian networks, Markov networks, and the use of information theory.
