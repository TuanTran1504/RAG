Academic Handbook Current Edition HORT 7001 Advanced Greenhouse Technology Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301358 Coordinator Michelle Mak Opens in new window Description This subject explores a range of advanced greenhouse technologies in Australia and overseas-from simple low-cost options, through to cutting-edge technology in energy and water-efficient production. Students will observe current status and future trends in the industry to examine how advanced technologies can improve sustainability measures along with the reliability of horticultural output. This subject focuses on engineering aspects of greenhouse horticulture systems as well as crop growth and development. The basics of crop growth and development and the physical principles of greenhouse systems at different levels will be taught. The main in depth topics of the subject are: the selection of suitable greenhouse technology, physics of greenhouse climate, greenhouse systems (passive greenhouse, climate controlled, closed or semi-closed greenhouse), cropping systems, cover materials and smart glass technologies, energy saving technologies, water and nutrient recycling, and robotics for de-leafing and picking.
