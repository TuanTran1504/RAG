Are we in the midst of and the cause of another mass extinction event? This subject will explore this idea by examining the processes that have led to, and are leading to species extinction and the current biodiversity crisis. Many of the methods and issues used in and associated with conservation will be covered in a variety of case studies, field and laboratory activities.
