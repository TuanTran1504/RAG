Academic Handbook Current Edition CHEM 2006 Inorganic Chemistry Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300899 Coordinator Feng Li Opens in new window Description This subject introduces students to a thorough study of coordination chemistry (discussing complexes, ligands, structure, isomerism, stability, reaction mechanisms, oxidation states, elements in the first transition series, coordination chemistry in biological systems). The subject then moves on to areas of fundamental inorganic chemistry, including bonding, and solid state chemistry. Advanced Modules cover the following topics: spectroscopy in coordination complexes, physiology and inorganic chemistry, and medicinal inorganic chemistry. This subject also introduces many of the laboratory techniques and equipment that are used in synthetic procedures in coordination chemistry.

Differentiate the varied roles of metals in biochemical systems.
Recognise the strengths and weaknesses of various bonding theories in coordination chemistry and apply them appropriately (ligand field theory, molecular orbital theory, valence bond theory).
Apply a knowledge of solvent properties and evaluate their effect on chemical systems.
Describe the structures and properties of ionic and non-ionic solids.
Apply the fundamental principles of inorganic chemistry to advanced areas through the Advanced Modules.
Research the literature of coordination chemistry and relate this to experimental results within an experimental Report.
Demonstrate laboratory techniques and conduct experiments in the coordination chemistry laboratory, acquire experimental data, analyse and communicate in written format as result sheets or reports(s).
Identify, interpret and comply with safety requirements in relation to the use of chemical reagents and laboratory equipment. Subject Content 1. Structure and Isomerism in Inorganic Chemistry
