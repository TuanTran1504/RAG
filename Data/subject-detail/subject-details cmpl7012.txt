Academic Handbook Current Edition CMPL 7012 Evidence Based Practice in Chinese Medicine Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401129 Coordinator Isabella Leung Opens in new window Description This subject will introduce and develop the concepts and principles of evidence-based practice as applied to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and explore specific aspects of research development. Furthermore, this subject will focus on the clinical applications of such research- based evidence and highlight integrative methods combining TCM and biomedical diagnostics and disease management.  Students will gain an understanding of the complexities, practicality, and applied methodologies used in research to establish the validity and reliability of TCM theories, diagnostics and interventional techniques in addition to the appropriateness of various outcome measures for research and clinical practice.   This subject will provide students with a practical skillset designed to facilitate location, evaluation, integration, and application of scientific research evidence in clinical practice whilst also preparing students for development of research proposals in subsequent subjects such as Research Protocol Design & Practice.
