Academic Handbook Current Edition TOUR 5002 Frontiers in Sustainable Tourism Practice and Places Credit Points 10 Coordinator Felicity Picken Opens in new window Description Tourism is a practice that both reflects and creates the changing, global world. International tourism is a key driver of the human experience of globalisation including the development of global citizenry, the opportunities and obligations that accompany this and the challenges, limitations and sometimes unintended effects of seemingly inconsequential travel choices. The tourism industry is concerned with the ongoing production of novel ways of experiencing the world and draws upon innovation in science and technology as well as imaginaries to accomplish this. This subject will examine how tourism creates and responds to futures in the realms of space, economy, culture and knowledge and how we can assess, evaluate and predict the effects of these.
