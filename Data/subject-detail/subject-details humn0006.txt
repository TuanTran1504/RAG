Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 0006 Australian Studies (WSTC Prep) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700213 Coordinator Chantal Rozairo Opens in new window Description Australian Studies aims to inform students of some of the aspects of the historical development of Australia and highlight some of the important physical, social, political and economic issues and events which have helped shape the development of Australia as an independent, modern nation.  The study of issues, events, attitudes and values in the Australian context along with the development of academic skills will assist students in their study of Humanities units at the tertiary level.  In addition, all students, especially international students, should acquire a better appreciation of the environment in which they live and learn to think more critically about issues facing people in the 21st  century.
