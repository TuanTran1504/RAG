Academic Handbook Current Edition INFO 3003 Human-Computer Interaction Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300570 Coordinator Omar Mubin Opens in new window Description A key component to the discipline of Information Systems is the understanding and the advocacy of the user in the development of IT applications and systems. IT graduates must develop a mind-set that recognizes the importance of users and organisational contexts. They must employ user centered methodologies in the development, evaluation, and deployment of IT applications and systems. This subject examines human-computer interaction in order to develop and evaluate software, websites and information systems that not only look professional but are usable, functional and accessible.

Indicate ways in which users' characteristics (i.e., age, education, cultural differences, disability etc.) require adaptation of a user interface to increase effectiveness.
Integrate appropriate user-centred design methodologies into the development of an application or website and recognise advantages and disadvantages of doing so.e.
Describe major usability guidelines and standards, for e.g. ISO or Nielsen
Develop both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes and produce user interfaces for domain specific applications.
Create an appropriate user evaluation plan with carefully chosen subjective and objective measures.
