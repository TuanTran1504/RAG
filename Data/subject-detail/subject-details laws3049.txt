Academic Handbook Current Edition LAWS 3049 Media Law Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200661 Coordinator Sarah Hook Opens in new window Description This subject examines various aspects of the laws that regulate the media. The central content of the subject consists of defamation, contempt, privacy and surveillance and a selection of other laws impacting upon this industry. Throughout the subject we will also explore two key themes. The first is whether, as a question of policy, current legal restrictions to media freedom appropriately balance the protection of free speech with various other interests, including protection of reputation, personal privacy and the effective administration of justice. The second theme asks whether media laws that were developed to regulate traditional mass-media organisations apply to individuals who publish their own content online, particularly via social media, and, if so, whether this application is appropriately balanced. Analysis of the application of existing media law principles to a range of new technologies will be featured throughout the subject. School Law Discipline Law, Not Elsewhere Classified.
