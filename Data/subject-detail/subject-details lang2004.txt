Academic Handbook Current Edition LANG 2004 Arabic 201 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102019 Coordinator Hakeem Kasem Opens in new window Description This is an intermediate level subject in Arabic intended for two groups of students: (a) students of English speaking backgrounds or other language backgrounds who have achieved a degree of competence in the language at least at the HSC Level; and (b) Arabic language background students whose education has been in English as the medium of instruction in all subjects other than Arabic and who, therefore, have some gaps in their knowledge of Arabic, particularly in situations requiring a more formal language register. The subject is designed to consolidate and advance the acquisition of Modern Standard Arabic for post beginner learners of the language. While consolidating language skills, students will also develop further knowledge of the Arab culture. A range of DELL (Digitally Enhanced Language Learning) activities are utilised as part of the blended learning mode of delivery for this subject. NOTE: Students enrolling in this subject as part of a major or sub major in Arabic must enrol in Arabic 202 at the same time.  Students with a background of study in the language may need to take higher level subjects. During the first two weeks of class, the lecturer will monitor the performance of students and advise students who need to transfer to a higher class. Students should consult the Languages Academic Course Advisor or Subject Coordinator if they are unsure of their appropriate level.
