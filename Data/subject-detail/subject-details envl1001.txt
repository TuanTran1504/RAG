Students become familiar with the terminology and concepts surrounding the natural landscape experientially through a series of field trips and develop an awareness and appreciation of both of the conceptual and actual landscape issues. Skills in mapping and spatial awareness skills and technologies will be developed through field trips and workshop sessions including GIS. Such skills will assist in developing a capacity to comprehensively describe and analyse the landscape. School Science Discipline Environmental Studies, Not Elsewhere Classified.
