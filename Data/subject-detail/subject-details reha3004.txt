Academic Handbook Current Edition REHA 3004 Clinical Education A (Acute Care) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400985 Coordinator Rocco Cavaleri Opens in new window Description This clinical education placement will provide the context for students to apply the theoretical and research knowledge and skills learnt in 400984 Cardiopulmonary Physiotherapy.   Students will be required to assess and treat clients in the acute care and intensive care settings. Assessments and treatments will focus on improving or preventing client impairments. These may include decreased mobility and function altered by acute illness or injury, which may be combined with a chronic disease or a disability. These assessment and treatments will tend to have a cardiorespiratory physiotherapy focus, but clients may also present with neurological and musculoskeletal conditions which require intervention. Students will, therefore, be expected to integrate knowledge and skills learnt across all physiotherapy-specific units in their provision of client-centred care as well as draw on more general knowledge and skills from earlier stages of the course.
