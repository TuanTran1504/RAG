Academic Handbook Current Edition MECH 3007 Thermal and Fluid Engineering Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300759 Coordinator Ming Zhao Opens in new window Description The subject provides an understanding of thermo-fluid principles and their engineering applications related to career pathways in  manufacturing, renewable energy, human health and the environment. In addition to examining theoretical principles, students’ analytical skills are developed as they evaluate thermal and fluid systems and apply basic computational techniques to solve problems in practical laboratory sessions. Students will explore topics such as aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, turbomachinery, combustion, and ventilation to develop industry applicable, practical skills.
