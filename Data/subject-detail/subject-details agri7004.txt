Academic Handbook Current Edition AGRI 7004 Livestock Production Systems Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301373 Coordinator Adrian Renshaw Opens in new window Description This subject covers the principles of animal production required to develop sustainable and efficient production systems to meet the challenges of domestic and global needs. It will cover the scientific principles (biochemical, anatomical and physiological) that underpin intensive and extensive animal production. These principles will be related to key production parameters and indicators including growth, reproduction, lactation and milk production, fibre production and breeding. Students will apply scientific principles to the planning of production in farming simulation models. Through these simulation programs students will explore production case studies and develop advisory plans. Focus areas include animal health and management, whole farm production systems and the challenges to animal production from changing climate, food safety and quality, consumer requirements and animal welfare.
