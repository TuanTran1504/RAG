This subject emphasises the evaluation and development of feasibility studies for the purposes of selecting development projects, evaluating different options and making the decision as to whether to proceed to a more detailed feasibility study. The subject provides students with the knowledge and skills to prepare a full feasibility report and analysis of a project's concept and financial feasibility. This is achieved through the application of theories and concepts to a case study. Students will have access to applications being used in the industry to complete a feasibility report. Additionally, students will develop skills to carry out both scenario and sensitivity testing on the outcomes of the proposed development project.
