Academic Handbook Current Edition COMM 2050 Multiliteracies Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102739 Coordinator Di Dickenson Opens in new window Description This subject develops students' skills, knowledge and competencies to address a wide range of literacies across multiple technologies, platforms and contexts, including the digital, written, visual, aural, spatial, gestural, and tactile dimensions of meaning production. In any society there are a range of literacies, and contexts in which those literacies might be deployed. Multiliteracies go beyond the traditional textual models of literacy to describe the rich variety of cognitive and cultural tools we use to make sense of the everyday. Multiliteracy is key to our professional and personal effectiveness as well as to our functioning as individuals and citizens in a world characterised by increasing local diversity and global connectedness.
