This subject will consider elements of the physical world around us: the phenomena we inhabit which form our sense of self. Focusing on literature and how meaning is created in literary form the subject will consider the interaction between the created world and the real world. It will focus on method and process in writing. In doing this it will engage with ideas from a number of areas, including science, philosophy, and literary theory in considering particular aspects of both our interaction with world, and how it shapes us, and the manner in which art shapes and forces itself upon the world. A specific theme related to the process of creation in art will be addressed. School Humanities & Comm Arts Discipline Creative Arts, Not Elsewhere Classified.
