Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 2070 First Peoples and Criminal Justice Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102916 Coordinator Lindsay McCabe Opens in new window Description How does colonialism underscore the foundational narratives, knowledges and operation of the legal and criminal justice institutions of colonised nations? Focusing primarily on the Australian context of colonial invasion and settlement, this subject explores the plight of Indigenous peoples and their severe over-representation in the Australian criminal justice system. Studying the impact of colonisation and exploring Indigenous narratives, students will critically examine  issues faced by Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people and their experience of criminal justice in Australia. Overall, the subject will equip students with an understanding of the relationship between dominant colonial narratives of race and institutional racism, while considering how Indigenous knowledge can inform better social and criminal justice outcomes for Indigenous populations. Comparative examples of criminal (in)justice for Indigenous populations in other colonised nations will also be considered.
