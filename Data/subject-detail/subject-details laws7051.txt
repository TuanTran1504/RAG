This subject examines law, theories and issues relevant to an ageing community. The legal issues are examined in a broad social, cultural and ethical context. Issues of legal capacity relevant not only to the law of contracts but also to delegated decision making, medical treatment and end of life decisions are considered. Similarly, the law relating to areas of special importance to the elder community such as, pensions, retirement villages, wills and estate planning and equitable remedies for financial elder abuse are also discussed.
