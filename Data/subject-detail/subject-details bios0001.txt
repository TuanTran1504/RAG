The subject is therefore seen to have relevance to the lives of students. It is important for students to develop an understanding of the biological principles that will enable them to make informed decisions about the advances that are occurring in biotechnology and biomedical science.  Undergraduate study in the life sciences requires the student to have acquired a basic body of knowledge that focuses on the diversity and the unity of living things as well as skills in collecting and analysing information and writing concise and coherent explanations.
