Academic Handbook Current Edition COMM 7004 In the Realms of the Sensory: Ecologies of Word, Sound and Image Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102342 Coordinator Peter Mauch Opens in new window Description This subject develops an awareness of the cultural, aesthetic and sensory contexts in which the communication, design and creative arts are practiced. It examines approaches to creative practice and the role that creativity and experimentation, as well as collaboration and social creativity, play in the research process. Particular attention is paid to visual, aural, and alphabetic technologies, and the form of augmented virtual realities and artefacts they create. Mimicry, novelty and improvisation, critique and speculation, 'handlability' or tacit knowledge are some of the practices and concepts studied. While the subject is designed for students engaged in creative research, it has relevance for those analysing creative works as part of their research.
