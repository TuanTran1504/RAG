Students gain an understanding of different theories related to producing texts in a range of modes for different purposes. They investigate a range of written and multimodal genres, their textual structures and grammar and learn to apply these in planning and teaching in mainstream, English as an Additional Language or Dialect (EAL/D) and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander contexts, gaining a critical awareness of varying pedagogic approaches. Students will develop skills in pedagogy and practice, including next practice, within English & Literacy for K-6 students. The knowledge and skills developed in the other subjects of study in the program can be applied in this subject and Professional Experience subjects. This subject is included in the Transition Phase of the Master of Teaching program.
