Research is also a social enterprise, with communities and norms of behaviour, and is an industry that is shaped by numerous cultural and economic forces. Taking a holistic approach that includes general research skill development, this subject focuses on four main topics: (1) critical reading, (2) effective writing, (3) research as a professional industry, and (4) the ethics of stewardship and personal responsibility. The subject equips students with vital skills that underpin their discipline-specific learning, and lays the ground for their development as professional researchers.
