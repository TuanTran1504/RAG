Academic Handbook Current Edition BIOS 3003 Advanced Sports Physiology Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400888 Coordinator Shona Papalia Opens in new window Description In 2017, this subject is replaced by 401146 - Applied Physiology. This subject presents the knowledge and laboratory skills essential to understanding the physiological demands on the sports participant, as well as to develop, implement and evaluate sports-specific training programs.  Students will develop the knowledge and skills necessary to perform and interpret results for a number of standard laboratory and field-based physiological tests used in talent identification and the assessment of high performance athletes.  Prescription focuses on the development and implementation of sport specific fitness programs. Also covered are the physiology of ergogenic aids, overtraining, muscle fatigue and soreness; physiological factors limiting performance; and physiological responses to exercise in challenging environments.

BIOS 2037 Equivalent Subjects BIOS 3022 - Sports Physiology Restrictions Students must be enrolled in program 4658 - Bachelor of Health Science (Sport and Exercise Science). Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Discuss how a variety of physiological, metabolic, hormonal and neural factors may limit athletic performance;
Explain the scientific basis for talent identification, the selection of athlete assessment procedures and the adaptations required for different age groups;
Organise, conduct and interpret the results of an array of physiological laboratory and field based techniques used in the assessment of high performance athletes and in talent identification including VO2max; anaerobic threshold, OBLA, anaerobic exercise capacity; plus muscular strength, power and endurance; flexibility (ROM); speed; power; general functional movement and functional skill; and other sport specific tests.
Identify the relative importance of the fitness components to performance in a sport and positions within a sport, and describe the effects of different types of sports training (and detraining) on physiological, hormonal, immunological, metabolic and neural responses and adaptations to exercise and on sport specific test results.
Demonstrate an ability to: assess athletes fitness; promote, design programmes, implement, supervise, demonstration, monitor and evaluate effective programs for individual athletes and sporting teams (who are children; adolescents, adults and older individuals) for training improvements in: flexibility, aerobic and anaerobic power and capacity, lactate tolerance, anaerobic threshold, metabolic efficiency, strength, speed and power.
Describe and explain the effects of challenging environments on sports training and performance including: heat, cold, altitude, pollution.
Explain the potential risks and benefits of various physiological ergogenic aids on exercise performance and general health including but not limited to the effects of anabolic steroids, autologous blood transfusion ('blood doping', erythropoietin and growth hormone.
Describe the signs, causes and contributing factors related to over training syndrome.
Explain how muscular fatigue, weakness, muscular soreness acute muscle soreness and delayed onset muscle soreness may affect biomechanics of motion and thus quality of training and sports performance.
Critically evaluate current research literature on the mechanisms on muscular fatigue, acute muscle soreness and Subject Content Testing of high performance athletes.
