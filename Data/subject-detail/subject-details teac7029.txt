Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 7029 Disability in Context Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102156 Coordinator Michelle Rose Opens in new window Description The developmental trajectory and quality of life of individuals with additional needs is affected not only by the nature and level of the disability itself but also by the ways in which that disability interacts with the contexts in which they live their lives. In turn, the impact of the disability will affect the individual’s family and those working with them. This subject adopts both a developmental and ecological perspective to enable analysis of the specific impact of disability on an individual, their family, the professionals working with them and the contexts in which they do so. In so doing, it evaluates the efficacy of theoretical models and frameworks available to assist in ensuring best outcomes for the individual and those around them.
