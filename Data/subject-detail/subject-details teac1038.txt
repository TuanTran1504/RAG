Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 1038 Literacy and Numeracy for Educators Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102794 Coordinator Robert Mcintosh Opens in new window Description The primary purpose of this subject is to equip first-year students with personal literacy and numeracy skills necessary for their academic success. This subject aims to develop studentsâ€™ personal literacy and numeracy skills necessary for participating in academic and professional contexts. It also supports pre-service teachers as literate and numerate citizens to strengthen positive attitudes, skills, and knowledge about literacy and numeracy roles in everyday contexts. Students will have opportunities to develop their interpersonal, verbal and non-verbal communication skills. These skills are integral to the inherent requirements of a graduate teacher who are required to undertake the national literacy and numeracy test mandated by the Australian Government. Pre-service teachers will develop confidence and competence in their understanding of the roles of literacy and numeracy in society, with particular emphasis on problem-solving and effective communication in practical situations. Students will be provided with opportunities to develop critical self-awareness, self-regulation and the ability to organise oneself as a self-directed learner. Essential elements of academic scholarship, including information media literacy, understanding assessment, and academic integrity, will be developed. This subject is included in the Foundation Phase of the Bachelor of Education.
