Academic Handbook Current Edition HLTH 2003 Biomechanics Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401140 Coordinator Peter Clothier Opens in new window Description The study of biomechanics, the science that examines the forces acting upon a structure and the effects of these forces, is essential for understanding how the human body moves during daily activities, exercise and sport. It is also important when considering where problems may arise with human movement, such as with disease processes, over exercising and injury and postural pathology. This subject is designed to introduce the student to biomechanics by studying: the mechanical principles of human movement: balance and equilibrium: mechanical factors involved in tissue type and motion; and the analysis of human movement.

Students also need to be able to apply basic concepts in maths and physics. Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Define and explain terms, principles and units of measurement that apply to the biomechanics of motion, sport and exercise.
Apply biomechanical principles as they relate to the description and analysis of motion, sport and exercise.
Solve quantitative problems related to kinematic and kinematic concepts.
Describe and illustrate examples of linear and angular analogues of Newton’s Laws of motion.
Identify and explain fluid mechanics principles as they apply to motion.
Illustrate and explain the biomechanical properties of human tissues, how these tissues respond to loading and how problems to the tissue may affect tissue functioning.
