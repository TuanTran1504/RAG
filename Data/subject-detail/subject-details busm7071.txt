Negotiation and conflict resolution errors can be costly to direct and indirect stakeholders. As such, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution Management will provide theoretical frameworks for students to develop the practical skills needed to manage the negotiation and conflict resolution needs of any organisation. Through the use of role play and simulations, students will be required to analyse corporate data and apply strategies to create a negotiated agreement.  It examines negotiation in different contexts including multiparty negotiations.  Emphasis is also placed on causes of conflict and how to identify potential indicators, leading to an analysis of the different conflict modes and patterns.
