Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 5023 Mental Health in Educational Contexts Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102912 Coordinator Roberto Parada Opens in new window Description This subject is designed to promote the application and integration of current psychological and educational pedagogy, theory, evidence and best practice in supporting students who may be experiencing mental health challenges in educational settings. A problem-based approach to learning and teaching is used, employing case-based vignettes depicting various specific mental health presentations. Students are required to determine how they will develop student, classroom and curriculum level interventions to promote the wellbeing and learning of young people in educational settings. This occurs through small group work and self-directed research in which students are encouraged to utilise their prior knowledge in the topic area and identify the gaps in their knowledge as they attempt to solve the problem whilst being supported by their tutor and peers.
