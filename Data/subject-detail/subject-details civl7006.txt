Academic Handbook Current Edition CIVL 7006 Advanced Structural Analysis Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300594 Coordinator Haiping Zhu Opens in new window Description This subject will introduce students at postgraduate level to structural analysis of trusses, beams, frames and plates. It covers the slope defection method and matrix method for analysis of beams, trusses and frames, and the bending and buckling analysis of beams and plates under various loading conditions. The theories learned in classes will be reinforced in practical sessions by using computer software packages.
