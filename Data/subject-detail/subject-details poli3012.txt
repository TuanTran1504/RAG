Academic Handbook Current Edition POLI 3012 The Politics of Civilisation Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102005 Coordinator Brett Bowden Opens in new window Description What is civilisation? What are civilisations? What does it mean to be civilised? What does it mean to be uncivilised, barbaric or savage? These are some of the key questions explored in this unit. We will investigate the normative demands of civilisation, from 16th Century European colonial 'civilising missions' to the 21st Century global war on terror. We will explore the history of relations between civilisations in light of the 'clash of civilisations' thesis, including relations between the Western and Islamic worlds. We will discover the power of ideas and the influence they can have on real world policy-making.
