Academic Handbook Current Edition TOUR 2001 Issues in Contemporary Heritage Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 101601 Coordinator Donna James Opens in new window Description In 2023 this subject is replaced by HUMN 2073 Issues in Contemporary Heritage. The aim of this subject is to get students thinking critically about heritage. To do so, it examines two main questions: "What is heritage?" and "Why does it matter?". While the answers to both may appear fairly straightforward, this subject is designed to make students question and problematise their own assumptions, rethink what is and is not heritage, and consider why, in fact, we even care at all. The subject will introduce concepts such as national identity, ethics, memorialisation, belonging, nostalgia, heritage values, status, control and repatriation. It will also introduce and examine heritage legislation, theory and practice. School Social Sciences Discipline Tourism Student Contribution Band HECS Band 4 10cp Check your fees via the Fees page.
