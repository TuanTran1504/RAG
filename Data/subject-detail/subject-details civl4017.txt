Academic Handbook Current Edition CIVL 4017 Surface Water Hydrology Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301329 Coordinator Surendra Shrestha Opens in new window Description Surface water hydrology covers the principles of hydrology as it pertains to surface water component of the hydrologic cycle. The principal focus is on the relationship between rainfall and surface runoff. The extent of flooding resulting from storm events will be evaluated through floodplain delineation process. Successful completion of this subject provides the competencies required to propose sustainable engineering solutions to potential adverse impacts of land-use changes. This subject builds on the hydraulic concepts acquired from the subjects completed earlier.
