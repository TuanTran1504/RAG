Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 2024 Design Graphics: Communication for Manufacture Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301290 Coordinator Mauricio Novoa Opens in new window Description Students will design manufacture ready product samples through the use of computer graphics including three-dimensional (3D) surfacing and solids modelling methods used by professionals engaged in engineering and industrial design practice. Students will produce two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) documentation, which can be widely applied to facilitate the understanding and production of parts and assemblies.
