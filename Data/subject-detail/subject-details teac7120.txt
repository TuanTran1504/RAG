Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 7120 STEM Pedagogies in Practice Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102511 Coordinator Mary Southall Opens in new window Description The purpose of this subject is for students to gain exposure to authentic contexts for integrating science, technology, engineering and mathematics and to develop knowledge and skills with designing and implementing STEM learning experiences.  Students will have the opportunity to complete an authentic interdisciplinary STEM task, and draw upon this experience to design and implement interdisciplinary STEM learning activities aligned to syllabus outcomes.  This subject will allow students to simulate and evaluate the teaching practices associated with high-quality interdisciplinary STEM lessons, and collaborate with peers who have expertise in different STEM disciplines.
