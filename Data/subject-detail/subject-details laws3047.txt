Academic Handbook Current Edition LAWS 3047 Law of International Organisations Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200803 Coordinator John Juriansz Opens in new window Description This subject examines the structure and functions of the world's major transnational organisations.  The subject extends students' understanding provided by Public International Law by examining the reality of international action and cooperation. Given that the European Union is the most highly evolved transnational organisation in the world today, the course will be centred around this organisation, while comparing it with other major international organisations such as the UN, the WTO and regional transnational organisations such as the African Union and the Organisation of American States. The Brexit process currently taking place in the EU will be analysed as a disruption to the trend of transnationalism.
