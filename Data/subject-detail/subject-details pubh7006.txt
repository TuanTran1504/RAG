Academic Handbook Current Edition PUBH 7006 Data Management and Programming for Epidemiology Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401179 Coordinator Sandro Martins Sperandei Opens in new window Description Modern epidemiology deals with ever increasing volumes of data and complexity of analysis. This course is aimed at equipping students with effective practices for managing data and programme code and ensuring the security of their data. Students will be taught the fundamentals of managing code and data in a revision control system as well as good programming practices and techniques which can form a basis for a robust, repeatable and test-driven research methodology. Programming instruction and exercises will use the SAS and R languages, and SQL databases.
