For these reasons many have embraced the philosophies of Total Quality Management (TQM). Central to its practice is a focus on flexible, consultative management, with the needs of the customer seen as vital to guiding a continuous process of improvement. TQM is a whole system concept, which recognizes the need to manage sets of interacting technical, cultural and political issues. This subject explores the various aspects of TQM and in particular its application within the health services.
