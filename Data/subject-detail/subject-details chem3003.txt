Academic Handbook Current Edition CHEM 3003 Advanced Inorganic Chemistry Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300907 Coordinator Feng Li Opens in new window Description Building on the foundations laid in Inorganic Chemistry, this subject focuses on structure and bonding in inorganic chemistry, and the stereochemistry of coordination complexes. Spectroscopic and magnetic properties of inorganic compounds are evaluated as a consequence of structure and bonding, and an introduction to X-ray methods for structure determination is given. Kinetics and mechanism of inorganic reactions are examined, and the area of bioinorganic chemistry is developed. Unique structures and reactions of organotransition metal chemistry are explored. Advanced Modules cover aqueous chemistry of cations and oxyanions, inorganic materials, molecular orbital theory in coordination complexes, group theory; lanthanides and actinides.
