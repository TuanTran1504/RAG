Academic Handbook Current Edition LANG 3029 Culture, Discourse and Meaning Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102185 Coordinator David McInnes Opens in new window Description In Culture, Discourse and Meaning students explore our culture by looking closely at how we make and share meaning. You look at how power operates by supporting and promoting some ideas and ways of life but not others. In Culture, Discourse and Meaning you also consider how students might change our culture. In your work in the unit, you will develop analytical, interpretive, and critical skills for culture analysis. Through project-based work, students will develop the capacity to analyse and critique the production and operations of power and consider changes in cultural practice.
