Academic Handbook Current Edition REHA 4021 The High Risk Foot Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401184 Coordinator Viv Chuter Opens in new window Description The subject builds on fundamentals of pathophysiology and podiatry specific subjects to understand and manage the impact of systemic disease on foot health. The subject specifically investigates pathology associated with the 'high risk foot' including lower extremity manifestations associated with vascular, endocrine, neurological pathology and immunosuppression. This subject aims to develop comprehensive, coherent and connected knowledge to assist making informed decisions and contribute to sustainable change and improvements in health care for people with systemic disease, with particularly emphasis on diabetes and wound management.

Learning Outcomes Critique the anatomical, physiological and pathophysiological differences of the arterial, venous, lymphatic and microvascular systems and discern between the diseases of these systems and their consequences in the lower extremity.
Execute a thorough examination of the lower extremity vasculature, diagnose vascular status, recognise limitations of these examinations during interpretation of results and instigate an appropriate management plan.
Appraise the structure and function of specific functional units of the nervous system, demonstrate knowledge of a range of neurological and neuromotor disorders and explore treatment options available with an emphasis on the role of the podiatrist in the interdisciplinary health care team.
Describe the physiological mechanisms of wound healing, in the presence or absence of normal physiological response and thorough examination and investigations and ascertain the underlying causes of the wound, and generate and implement appropriate strategies to return the tissues to their most functional levels by addressing both the wound and the underlying causes.
Discuss the physiological basis of the clinical manifestations of diabetes mellitus as it affects multiple organ and functional systems by performing appropriate examinations (vascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, dermatological and psychosocial).
Diagnose, evaluate and treat the foot conditions presented by the person with diabetes mellitus, in particular dermal ulcers and explain the role of physical therapies, particularly footwear and orthotic therapy in the ongoing patient management, and health education and promotion strategies.
Define a range of conditions associated with impaired carbohydrate metabolism, including gestational diabetes, and impaired glucose tolerance; and be familiar with the syndrome Diabetes Insipidus for purposes of client education and communication with the allied health team.
Appraise the common causes of immunosuppression affecting the at-risk foot and generate a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of those infectious diseases which are of particular importance in the practice of podiatry.
Evaluate possible routes of transmission of infectious diseases with particular emphasis on cross infection and discuss and implement universal precautions in clinical practice settings.
Determine the impact of infectious disease on the physical, emotional and psychological wellbeing of the individual.
