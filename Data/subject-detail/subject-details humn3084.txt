Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 3084 Theories of Conflict and Violence Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 100969 Coordinator Mark G. E. Kelly Opens in new window Description Why do humans kill?  What is the nature of war?  This course is a selection of different established theories offering explanations of human violence and social conflict.  Both theories of individual violence and aggression, and collective conflict are studied to give students a perspective on the forces behind these phenomena.  Theories from politics, philosophy, psychoanalysis, sociobiology, sociology, and cultural studies are introduced to exemplify the classic positions and lines of reasoning.  These are used to question and explain current forms of violence and conflict, and to give students better understanding of the issues behind attempts to forestall, manage or end conflict.
