Authentic case scenarios of paediatric clients will encourage students to integrate theoretical knowledge, clinical reasoning, and practical speech pathology skills to plan and evaluate approaches to working with children, their families and the communities in which they live. Individual, targeted and universal intervention strategies will be addressed within the context of collaborative, family centred philosophy.
