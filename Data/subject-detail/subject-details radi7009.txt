Academic Handbook Current Edition RADI 7009 Principles of Cardiac Sonography 4 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401188 Coordinator Paul Stoodley Opens in new window Description In Spring 2025, this subject will be replaced by RADI - 7025 - Applied Cardiac Sonography. This subject aims to assure that students have gained adequate knowledge and skills to be able to practice competently and confidently as cardiac sonographers. Students will learn about more complex heart dis-ease and how to detect them by echocardiography and other imaging modalities. They will further devel-op their research skills and start contributing to the sonographic practice through conducting a case pro-ject and presenting the report to the professional audience. The university library's vast teaching and re-search resources will provide an important means for facilitating learning in this subject.
