Level Undergraduate Level 1 subject Equivalent Subjects LGYA 4423 Concepts of Mathematics Incompatible Subjects LGYA 4295 Mathematics for Business MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1 Restrictions Students may complete the three subjects Quantitative Thinking, Analysis of Change and Maths 1A in the following order: MATH 1026 Quantitative Thinking, MATH 1001 Analysis of Change, MATH 1014 Mathematics 1A. This means that students may complete MATH 1026 before attempting MATH 1001, but not after. MATH 1001 and MATH 1026 may be attempted before MATH 1014, but not after. Students may not enrol in MATH 1026 and MATH 1001 or MATH 1026 and MATH 1014 or MATH 1001 and MATH 1014 in the same teaching session. Students enrolled in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours), Bachelor of Engineering or Bachelor of Engineering Science may not enrol in any of the subjects MATH 1001, MATH 1026 or MATH 1014. Assumed Knowledge Mathematics achieved at Bands 5-6, or knowledge equivalent to 300830 Analysis of Change.
