Academic Handbook Current Edition ARCH 7021 Architecture Studio Autumn Intensive Credit Points 10 Coordinator Michael Chapman Opens in new window Description 
This subject will introduce students to real world urban transformation design scenarios and clients in an intensive and site-based manner. Architecture Studio Autumn Intensive focusses on architectural interventions for complex urban scenarios, giving students exposure to issues of scale, spatial design, design detailing and fabrication.  With a focus on small-scale buildable interventions, students will be expected to apply skills in design, brief development, user analysis, communication and collaboration in the context of complex urban environments. The subject provides students with an immersive multi-disciplinary design studio experience, introducing them to skills in conceptual thinking and developed design that can be applied to the design of urban interventions. Students will also be introduced to clients, users and consultants in an environment that will prepare them for working in professional architecture and design settings. In order to communicate their design to a range of audiences, students will learn skills in communication, architectural modelling and visualisation in the representation of design solutions for multiple audiences.
