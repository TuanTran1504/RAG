Academic Handbook Current Edition ECON 3017 Macroeconomic Measures and Models Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200926 Coordinator Mamta Chowdhury Opens in new window Description The subject equips students with formal tools to analyse macroeconomic problems. Students learn to use macroeconomic terms and measures competently in discussion, and interpret data from the income, product, external and government accounts, and labour force surveys. Through hands-on experience constructing and applying price indices, deflators and productivity measures, they acquire practical skills and a sound conceptual understanding of economic variables and the accounting framework. Students come to appreciate the power of macroeconomic models, learning how to capture myriad mechanisms and feedbacks in a single framework, for example to define and quantify multipliers and crowding-out effects. Finally, students gain an understanding of fundamental external constraints, such as international parity and balance of payments equilibrium conditions.
