Academic Handbook Current Edition MECH 3006 Mechatronic Design Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300487 Coordinator Karthick Thiyagarajan Opens in new window Description Through practical lab exercises and a design project, students will integrate basic skills of mechanics, mechanical systems, and automation in the practice of engineering design (Design for X and system engineering) as applied to mechatronic devices and systems. Students will perform detailed design analysis on important machine elements such as bearings, brakes, clutches, shaft, motor and to integrate those elements to form an automatic mechatronic system is the intended outcome of undertaking this unit. The project-based tasks incorporated into this program build team work experience as well as each student's individual capabilities.
