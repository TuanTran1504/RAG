This subject considers the role of policy in international and national healthcare.  It examines policy making as both a rational and linear process responding to population health needs in just and fair ways, and the reality of policy making which occurs within a complex socio-political and economic environment shaped by powerful groups. Therefore, the aim of this subject is to consider how health professionals can develop effective evidence-based policy and the role advocacy can play in the health policy arena to engender greater health equity.
