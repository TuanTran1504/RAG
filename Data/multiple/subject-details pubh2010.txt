Academic Handbook Current Edition PUBH 2010 Epidemiology Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300872 Coordinator Arua Kalu Opens in new window Description Epidemiology is an analytical science concerned with the distribution and determinants of health-related states in populations, aimed at the management of health problems. Epidemiology is not limited to controlling epidemics but assesses and manages physical, mental and social well-being in living, working and recreational environments. The subject introduces identification and understanding of risk factors for health and disease, and assists the student to develop an investigation protocol for assessing a specific health state within their own field of interest. This addresses career needs for a range of health studies while introducing the epidemiological analytical approach to risk assessment and research.
