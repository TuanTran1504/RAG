Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 2035 Human Systems Physiology 2 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301270 Coordinator Kayte Jenkin Opens in new window Description Human Systems Physiology 2 builds upon the core concepts and terminology introduced in Concepts in Physiology and Human Systems Physiology 1, focusing on the function of visceral organs and explore how these organ systems are regulated, integrated, and function within the human body. The focus will be on the lymphatic, immune, digestive, renal and reproductive systems. Students will   collect, interpret and analyse data to develop an understanding of the physiological responses of the human body.

Level Undergraduate Level 2 subject Pre-requisite(s) NATS 1010 - Human Anatomy and Physiology 2 Restrictions Successful completion of 60 credit points Assumed Knowledge Concepts in physiology topics such as physical and chemical principles of physiology, homeostasis and Human Systems Physiology 1, a subject which will cover the nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, muscle and respiratory systems. Human Systems Physiology 2 focuses on visceral organ systems, however, knowledge developed in Human Systems Physiology 1 (particularly regarding how the nervous and endocrine systems regulate organ systems) will help students in their understanding of the content covered in Human Systems Physiology 2. Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Explain the functions and controls of the lymphatic, immune, digestive, renal, and reproductive systems of the body
Describe how the function of different organ systems of the body integrate to maintain homeostasis.
Collect and interpret data from practical and learning workshop classes to investigate physiological principles
Communicate effectively  in discussions of physiology. Subject Content -Blood and immune systems
-Lymphatic system
-Renal system
-Digestive system
-Reproductive system Special Requirements Essential equipment All students are required to have and wear closed-toed shoes, laboratory coat and safety glasses when working in the Physiology laboratory spaces. Students need to complete and provide evidence of an online WHS induction quiz before entering the first practical class.
