- The Water 4 Life minor addresses the interdependence of the environment, climate, human rights, gender inequality, population health, sustainability, and economic growth in relation to water. As the world faces critical issues, solutions to complex problems around water supply are essential. Students are challenged in this minor to integrate multidisciplinary, and systems approaches to generate ideas, identify problems, and create sustainable solutions. Students complete a core ‘capstone’ unit applying technological skills and environmental knowledge to develop a social action project for positive change.
- This minor is a Challenge Minor, which is an innovative transdisciplinary minor co-created with students as partners. With a Challenge Minor, your learning reaches beyond your discipline, giving you the chance to amplify your learning in new directions. For more information, visit the Challenge Minor website.
