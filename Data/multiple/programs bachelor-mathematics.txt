- The Bachelor of Mathematics will commence in 2022.
- The essence of mathematics is the use of abstraction and logic to discover, describe and completely and unambiguously understand systems. Mathematics is essential for modelling phenomena in many fields, including science, engineering, economics, finance, medicine, and politics. The fact that mathematicians are able to model, analyse and solve practical problems makes them highly sought after by employers. The Bachelor of Mathematics will give you a solid basis in key areas of mathematics. You also have the option of completing majors in Financial Mathematics, Data Science, or Computational Mathematics, or you can use the degree as a pathway to secondary teaching.
- Study Mode
- Three years full-time or six years part-time.
