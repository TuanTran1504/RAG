This subject introduces students to multidisciplinary approaches to the study of Islam and invites students to consider the construction and deconstruction of Islamic Studies as a field of study at various stages of history. The subject provides students with the opportunity to gain increased awareness of both the debates within the field and those that scrutinise the field. That is, becoming comfortable with interrogating the cluster of theoretical and methodological strategies for scholarly inquiry into Islamic Studies.
