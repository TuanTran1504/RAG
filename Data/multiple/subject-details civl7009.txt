Academic Handbook Current Edition CIVL 7009 Advanced Water Engineering Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300595 Coordinator Surendra Shrestha Opens in new window Description This subject introduces advanced principles of engineering hydrology as it pertains to the surface water component of the hydrologic cycle. Students are exposed to floodplain analysis techniques focusing on practical engineering solutions to issues originating from catchment development. Students are exposed to commonly used hydraulic and hydrologic software packages to delineate flooded areas resulting from such developments. Careers incorporating engineering hydrology are in demand across government, NGO and industrial sectors.
