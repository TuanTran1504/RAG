It focuses on understanding the changes which occur from infancy to maturity and the impact of congenital or acquired conditions, or lifestyle diseases causing dysfunction. Clinical and ethical reasoning and family-centred practice are both stressed. The approach will also emphasise the role of physiotherapy within inter-professional teams to prepare for different work settings (acute care, rehabilitation and/or community). The subject integrates prior learning from previous years (especially subjects related to neurology, musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary physiotherapy and exercise rehabilitation).
