Academic Handbook Current Edition BLDG 3014 Introduction to Building Fire Safety Credit Points 10 Coordinator Md Kamrul Hassan Opens in new window Description This subject provides the foundations in fire safety engineering principles and the techniques and tools used in building fire safety design. Students learn the key principles of fire and heat transfer, building material and cladding systemsâ€™ behaviours in fire, fire testing methods, fire-damage assessment methods, and concepts of performance-based building fire safety design. Using examples of fire engineering briefs and reports, students expand their knowledge and skills in real-world contexts. It also builds the skills required for a work-ready graduate and allows the student to plan, undertake and report on a specific aspect of practice in the context of their work.
