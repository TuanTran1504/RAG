- Associate Degree in Engineering
- The Associate Degree in Engineering is a two-year program (full-time) in Engineering designed for people who have workplace experience and wish to upgrade their qualifications in Engineering and possibly continue to the full Bachelor degree program. The Associate Degree in Engineering has a common first year program for all engineering disciplines, exposing students to a wide range of experiences in the first year. In the second year students may choose from the majors in Civil, Electrical, Mechanical or Robotics & Mechatronics. If students choose to apply to study in the the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) after graduating from the Associate Degree in Engineering they may be given advanced standing in up to 12 subjects.

- Diploma in Engineering/Bachelor of Engineering Studies
- In addition to providing training in conventional mechanical engineering subjects, the major introduces students to subjects of study that address sustainability including sustainable design and sustainable energy engineering. Graduates will be well equipped with broad-based skills that meet the demand of Australian industries and are conscious of the need to promote sustainable design and practices. Examples include mechanical and machinery design; manufacturing; energy production; and marketing and management activities. Skills gained are required in industries such as manufacturing, materials handling, automobile, aerospace, mining, building services and infrastructure development.

- Qualification for this award requires the successful completion of 320 credit points, which include the subjects listed in the recommended sequence below.
- * All students undertaking the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) are required to enrol in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary and undertake a readiness test at the beginning of their study.
- MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary
- The readiness test will be conducted at the beginning of the first semester of enrolment and the result will be used to determine whether a student will remain in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary or be transferred by the School to MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1.
- MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary
- MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1
- Students remaining in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary will be required to complete MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1 during second semester and will be encouraged to complete MATH 1019 Mathematics for Engineers 2 during the Summer session.
- MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary
- MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1
