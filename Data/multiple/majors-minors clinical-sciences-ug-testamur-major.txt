- Clinical Sciences, Testamur Major (T109)
- Western Sydney University Major Code:
- The Clinical Sciences testamur major offers study in a suite of clinical health sciences subjects, that prepares students for a clinical health career via additional bachelor or postgraduate study. The subjects have been specifically selected based on the assumed knowledge requirements of graduate-entry clinical health courses such as in physiotherapy, occupational therapy, podiatric medicine and speech pathology. Completion of the Bachelor of Health Science (Clinical Sciences) provides eligibility for admission, to most post-graduate health courses. The subjects in this testamur major are not equivalent to the clinical science subjects of the medicine courses. The Clinical Sciences testamur major is attached to a core suite of health science subjects that focus on professional and ethical conduct, social determinants of health, psychology and evidence-based practice. This ensures a comprehensive foundation for practice in the health sector. Students also complete 80 credit points of electives which they can use to complete a second major, or minors in public health, recreation, exercise and sport development or health management. These flexible study options help diversify the knowledge base and skill set of graduates. The health science core subjects and electives may be available to students online. The program is interdisciplinary in nature and travel between campuses for classes may be required.
