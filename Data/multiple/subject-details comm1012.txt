Academic Handbook Current Edition COMM 1012 Data, Mediation, Power Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102421 Coordinator Adam Daniel Opens in new window Description Data, Mediation, Power investigates the operation of power in contemporary digital media cultures and economy. The subject examines the primary role played by data in determining how we live in the world. This includes how we interact with the world, its people and digital artefacts, in terms of communication and meaning. The subject focuses on technologies of control and governance related to algorithmic architectures and data economies. Who benefits from data and mediation and what are the limits and possibilities of data? Ultimately, this kind of critical analysis invites us to think about what constitutes a just, democratic society and what constitutes an ethical media life.
