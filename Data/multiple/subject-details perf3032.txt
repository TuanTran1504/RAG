Academic Handbook Current Edition PERF 3032 Music and Cultural Frameworks Credit Points 10 Coordinator Michelle Stead Opens in new window Description The cultural frameworks of this subjectâ€™s title are both the lenses through which we receive and critique music (gender, class, postcolonialism, sexuality, power etc) and the various types of writing through which we perform these critiques. Through this subject, students will be immersed in literature that engages with music through those big lenses, but will also consider various types of writing. Journal articles, conference papers, liner notes, program notes and reviews each do a distinct kind of cultural work. The assessment tasks will enable students to think about their subject positions and develop both their cultural engagement and capacity to choose appropriate forms for their writing.
