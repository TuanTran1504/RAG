Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 2028 New Product Innovation with IoT Data Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301305 Coordinator Sasha Alexander Opens in new window Description Design Thinking has had a considerable effect on the ways firms innovate, design and evaluate products and services for use. The evolution of smart products and services in recent years offers both challenges and rewards for organisations as the big data generated provides insights to current product and service utilisation. Interpretation and integration of these new knowledge streams can support future product development, by enhanced understanding of human behaviour and features of sensor technologies. Students will produce an IoT influenced project design brief that provides the directional basis for the deployment of both human and technological resources in preparation for their career progression as a future innovation manager in a global, online marketplace.
