Students will also integrate and apply the knowledge and skills learnt in musculoskeletal, cardiorespiratory and neurological physiotherapy, as well as other health science units to provide appropriate and holistic family-centred care to paediatric clients. Students will be required to assess and treat paediatric clients in acute hospital, rehabilitation or community settings. This approach to management involves the consideration of a child's age, development, and diagnosis during assessment and treatment. Advanced communication skills are required to educate parents and children on the prevention and management of paediatric conditions.
