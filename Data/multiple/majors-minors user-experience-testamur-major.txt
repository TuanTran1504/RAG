- User experience (UX) is key to the success of organisations in shaping great products and services. Taking a user centred approach, students in this major design interactive digital applications, information systems and services that meet the needs of their target market. Students learn about design as a systematic and data driven process, backed up by up-to-date theoretical and practical knowledge, enabling them to design efficient and effective artefacts in a rapidly changing, fast paced environment. In this multidisciplinary field, students incorporate analytics, research, human factors, security and privacy into their designs using a range of technologies. Skills developed in this major prepare students for UX careers in a diverse range of business and industry environments, wherever interactions with clients or the general public are essential.
