Academic Handbook Current Edition RADI 7006 Principles of Cardiac Sonography 1 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401185 Coordinator Paul Stoodley Opens in new window Description In Autumn 2024, this subject replaced by RADI 5001 - Physics for Diagnostic Ultrasound. This subject introduces students to two key areas of knowledge for cardiac sonographers: 1) cardiac anatomy and physiology, and 2) ultrasound physics. Students will learn about the normal and abnormal anatomy and physiology of the human heart. They will also learn about the essential physical principles that underpin ultrasound imaging. This subject provides an essential basis for future study in the Graduate Diploma in Cardiac Sonography.
