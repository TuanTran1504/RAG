Academic Handbook Current Edition NURS 7034 Midwifery Practice 1 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401090 Coordinator Beth Peck Opens in new window Description In this subject students will develop skills for the provision of midwifery care across the childbirth continuum through working with women in a continuity of care model and also practice experience in designated maternity practice areas.  Using a woman-centred, primary health care model, students will commence recruitment and follow 10 women throughout their pregnancy, labour, birth and for up to six weeks post birth; and under supervision will provide midwifery care to these women. The subject commences with a one week intensive workshop, to expose the students to an elementary level of understanding and application of midwifery care in the antenatal clinic, antenatal ward, birth unit, postnatal ward and special care nursery in preparation for their employment.  Concepts introduced during this intensive week will be covered with more complexity during future subsequent weekly workshops.
