Academic Handbook Current Edition BIOS 2041 Vertebrate Zoology Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301257 Coordinator Christopher Turbill Opens in new window Description This subject examines the functional ecology and diversity of vertebrate animals (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals). It combines anatomy, physiology, ecology and behaviour, to explain how vertebrates survive and reproduce in relation to their environment. We will uncover the evolutionary relationships among vertebrate groups, and examine their adaptations to different environmental challenges. The subject also explores patterns in vertebrate diversity, with a focus on Australian ecosystems. Students further develop their knowledge of the scientific method to conduct their own project to investigate how environmental factors influence vertebrate animal abundance and diversity.  Students may be required to travel to another campus to undertake this subject. School Science Discipline Zoology Student Contribution Band HECS Band 2 10cp Check your fees via the Fees page.

Describe the processes and explain patterns in the phylogenetic (evolutionary) history and current diversity of vertebrate animals
Compare and contrast the structure and function of major body systems in vertebrate animals to understand their evolution in response to different environmental challenges
Interpret the ecological function of variation in morphological, physiological and behavioural traits among vertebrate animals in relation to their environment, especially from an Australian perspective
Review the diversity of vertebrate animal species and identify human-induced environmental changes that threaten the viability of animal populations
Apply the scientific method and work collaboratively to conduct and analyse a research project addressing the environmental factors that determine the diversity and abundance of vertebrate animal species Subject Content - Structure and function of major vertebrate animal groups
