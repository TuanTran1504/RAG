Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 3058 Pharmacological Chemistry Credit Points 10 Description This interdisciplinary subject covers the principles of medicinal chemistry, which combines chemistry, physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology. The subject focuses on the principles of medicinal chemistry and aims to provide students with an understanding of the relationships between atomic interactions and molecular structure to biomolecular targets and quantitative structure-activity relationships of drugs. Through the exploration of lead compounds design and discovery strategies, chemical synthesis, structure-activity relationship analysis, and in silico-aided methods, students will gain an understanding of the principles of drug design. The subject also emphasises on selected topics of medicinal chemistry including anti-microbial and chemotherapeutic agents to understand and explore their chemistry and structure-activity relationships. Practical experience in compound isolation, synthesis, purification, and characterization is also provided, allowing students to gain hands-on knowledge of the dynamic field of medicinal chemistry.
