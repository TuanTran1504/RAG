Academic Handbook Current Edition REHA 7005 Complex Cases and Professional Issues Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401049 Coordinator Daniel Thomson Opens in new window Description From 2018 students should take 401108 Complex Cases and Professional Issues. In this subject, students will further develop their clinical reasoning with respect to clients with complex presentations. A framework will be presented, which synthesises complex information such as the theory, research and skills in musculoskeletal, cardiorespiratory and neurological physiotherapy across the lifespan, and theories related to professionalism, ethics, safety and communication. This framework will be applied to the area of Intensive Care, where students will develop further knowledge and skills in specific cardiorespiratory techniques such as manual hyperinflation and suctioning. This subject also contains the discussion of a range of recent professional developments in physiotherapy, which are relevant to entry level practitioners. These include registration as a physiotherapist, continuing education, workload control strategies, duty of care responsibilities and quality improvement processes (including critical reflection), employment strategies and career pathways.
