Academic Handbook Current Edition NURS 7028 Leadership in Clinical Practice Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400235 Coordinator Ethar Ahmad Attalla Alsharaydeh Opens in new window Description We are all confronted with the challenge of leadership, regardless of nursing or other healthcare speciality, role, or status. Encompassed within leadership is knowledge of self, relevant theories, skills, and political awareness which are developed through higher education. By developing leadership skills and knowledge we can influence better outcomes for our patients/clients and create more positive working environments.   In the unit, Leadership in Clinical Practice, nursing and other healthcare leadership arising from expert clinical practice is explored as a general notion rather than as one arising from any particular clinical speciality. Content includes theories, concepts and styles of leadership, the development of leadership potential, motivation, coaching, and mentorship, concepts of power, authority and empowerment and discussion of contemporary leadership issues. Assignments provide students with the opportunity to apply new knowledge about leadership to their practice, whether they be in management, education, or clinical roles.
