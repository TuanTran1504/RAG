This area of law is relatively new and continually developing and expanding. This subject is primarily concerned with how law has and should respond to various health dilemmas at the population level. These include State protection of the community from death (for example requiring road users to wear a seatbelt or helmet) and disease including both communicable disease (for example immunisation, quarantine and managing disease outbreaks) and non-communicable disease (for example smoking, alcohol, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease).  This subject also considers frameworks for evaluating whether public health laws are justifiable regulation, taking into account the balance between public good and the autonomy of individuals.
