Case examples include, Australia, America, China, Hong Kong, Scandinavia, United Kingdom and India.  Students use the principles of economics to assess funding of health with a focus on the interface between economics, ethics and equity in decision making. They also consider the tendency for health systems to be organised around economic principles in areas such as, contracting out, health insurance and pharmaceuticals.  Students are encouraged to reflect on the challenges and future directions of their own health system in the context of the unit components.
