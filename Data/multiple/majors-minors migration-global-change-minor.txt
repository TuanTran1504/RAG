- The Migration and Global Change minor offers a transdisciplinary approach to understanding and working in careers related to migration, an issue touching on almost every facet of life in contemporary Australia. The minor provides theoretical grounding in the dynamics of migration that students apply in real-world problems provided by external partners. Multidisciplinary offerings from health science, law, business, social sciences, and the arts provide the foundations for a transdisciplinary core unit ‘capstone’ designed around an individual or team-based local or international (digital or physical) learning experience with university partners in Australia,  Asia or Africa. Students who graduate will have deep awareness of the value of migration, be able to manage and mitigate challenges which arise, and will gain new networks and experiences that make them job ready.
- This minor is a Challenge Minor, which is an innovative transdisciplinary minor co-created with students as partners. With a Challenge Minor, your learning reaches beyond your discipline, giving you the chance to amplify your learning in new directions. For more information, visit the Challenge Minor website.
