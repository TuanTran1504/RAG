Academic Handbook Current Edition BLDG 4014 Building Design Project (Development Application) Credit Points 20 Coordinator Mary Hardie Opens in new window Description This is a capstone subject, where students will source a suitable design project at their own initiative to illustrate the skills they have developed throughout their program. The project will contain a high level of complexity exceeding that of previous building designs produced in the program. Diverse stakeholder input on the project's impact will be gathered and assessed. The design solution generated will show mastery of resolving complex design problems which integrate technical knowledge with economic and social responsibility based on extensive justifying research. These skills are highly sought after by employers in the building design industry.
