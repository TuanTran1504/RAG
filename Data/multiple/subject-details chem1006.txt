Academic Handbook Current Edition CHEM 1006 Essential Chemistry 2 (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700122 Coordinator Phillip Newman Opens in new window Description This subject introduces an investigation of the reactivity of covalent molecules, in particular, of carbon-based compounds. Focussing on introductory chemical dynamics and thermodynamics, students will develop an in-depth understanding of the structure, nomenclature and reactivity of the principal organic functional groups, extending their basic principles of chemistry. They will also understand how molecules are synthesised and the ways they react being important in the function and role of chemistry in biological systems in our domestic and industrial worlds.
