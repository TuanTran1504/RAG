Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 5001 Borders, Mobilities and Justice Credit Points 10 Coordinator Selda Dagistanli Opens in new window Description What kinds of illegal activities occur between and across borders? What do governments mean when they refer to “illegal immigrants”? This subject has a critical human security focus that aims to distinguish between illegal activity across borders and highly politicised narratives around immigration and asylum seeking. By examining the tensions between security, order and justice, the subject will focus on the increased demand for immigration and resettlement in a world marked by political unrest, global pandemics, and climate change. As such, students will critically examine notions of human mobility and the physical, legal and discursive construction of borders, and what that means pre and post-immigration for certain segments of the global population. These issues will be explored through global perspectives and with an interdisciplinary focus, emphasizing the impact of global issues on human lives. One of the core aims of this subject is to give students the ability to critically appraise how current domestic and international practices deployed by governments can perpetuate humanitarian and security crises, as well as the ever-increasing inequality between rich and poor nations. By the end of this subject, students will be able to make theoretically informed recommendations across rapidly changing and comparative national and political contexts.
