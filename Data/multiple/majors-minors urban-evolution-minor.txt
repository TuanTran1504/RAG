- Urban Evolution is a 21C Minor that will transform the way you think about our cities, preparing you to become a leader in innovative and agile transformation. You will contribute to projects that demonstrate how urban design improves mobility, environmental sustainability, disaster prevention, well-being, and social inclusiveness, and you will learn how robust and effective stewardship of biodiversity improves food production, water quality and addresses the extinction crisis. The distribution of urban prosperity is uneven, often marked by striking spatial, social, health and economic inequalities. Cities are also vulnerable to climate shocks and produce outsized share of carbon emissions and declines in biodiversity. But they are the key to climate sustainability and where green investments have the biggest impact. Urban Evolution embeds global ideas of sustainability with industry partnership and focuses on the promotion of resource efficiency and waste conscious, smart green solutions through the circular economy.
- This minor is a Challenge Minor, which is an innovative transdisciplinary minor co-created with students as partners. With a Challenge Minor, your learning reaches beyond your discipline, giving you the chance to amplify your learning in new directions. For more information, visit the Challenge Minor website.
