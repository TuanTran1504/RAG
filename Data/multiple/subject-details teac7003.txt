Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 7003 Addressing Diversity in Science Teaching and Learning Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102486 Coordinator Karina Mckoy Opens in new window Description The purpose of this subject is for students to develop knowledge of science teaching for primary aged children of science with additional needs and diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Students will explore a range of needs, including gender issues with science learning, EAL/D backgrounds, learning difficulties, and gifted and talented abilities, and identify strategies to respond to those needs with specific instructional plans. In addition, students will learn to implement culturally relevant and context-based pedagogies in primary science education.
