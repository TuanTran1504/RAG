Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 4002 Researcher Development 2: Proposing and Justifying Research Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 800220 Coordinator Michael O'Connor Opens in new window Description An essential skill required by researchers is the ability to propose research and justify it in a persuasive manner. Through interactive workshops, Researcher Development 2 helps students develop and refine a research proposal. The subject includes workshops on research ethics that will help students articulate the significance and relevance of their work and will assist those requiring ethics clearance. The written proposal is defended through the oral Presentation of Proposal (POP). After successful completion of this subject, students will have demonstrated an ability to design and justify a research project in their discipline.
