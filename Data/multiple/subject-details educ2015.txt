Academic Handbook Current Edition EDUC 2015 Education for Sustainability (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Coordinator Mitchell Liddle Opens in new window Description Increasingly, the need to develop sustainable ways of living that can reduce our ecological footprint and conserve precious natural resources for future generations is recognised as a critical concern of education at all levels. Developing 'sustainability literacy' requires new ways of thinking and learning that enable us to recognise the connections between environmental concerns, social patterns, and individual actions. This subject approaches key issues in sustainability education with a learner-centred approach that builds skills for inquiry, analysis and creative action and involves a three-hour field trip. It promotes personal and social change, develops civic values, and will empower students to be a leader for a sustainable future. School Education Discipline Education, Not Elsewhere Classified.
