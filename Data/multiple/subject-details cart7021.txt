This subject will focus on a particular idea or concept that is of major importance to the diverse cultural, artistic and philosophical understandings we have of ourselves. It will then look to explore how the idea operates through these differing understandings and the problems it poses for representation. The theoretical and creative texts examined will focus both on the nature of the idea and how it might be better understood or made use of in creative practice.
