Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 3101 Social Sciences International Placement (II): Placement Credit Points 20 Legacy Code 102724 Coordinator Peta Hinton Opens in new window Description This subject provides students with the opportunity to apply skills and knowledge acquired during the first two years of their degree to a 'real world' setting. Students will undertake a 14 week internationally focused placement with organisations in, for example, the community, not-for-profit or government sectors. The subject coordinator will partner students with an international organisation, and together with the placement host(s) will jointly supervise the student. The work that students undertake during placement will vary, but may include: community visits, community consultation, development of educational programs, policy evaluation, research and report writing. Relevant activities may also be undertaken at another university in the placement country. The work placement will provide students with invaluable experience working in social sciences related fields in cross-cultural contexts. Prior to commencing the placement, students are required to complete pre-placement coursework (in co-requisite subject HUMN 3100 Social Sciences International Placement (I)).  On return from placement the experience will be rounded out with the completion of HUMN 3102 Social Sciences International Placement (III). Students are required to complete a Working with Children Check, and medical clearance may also be required to undertake placement in a developing country, along with a Working With Children check for certain organisations.  Those students unable to undertake an internationally based placement for health or personal reasons should contact the Subject Coordinator before enrolment in this subject to discuss available options for being placed locally.  Students should also note that NSW Health facilities have further, specific requirements, and should seek advice from the Subject Coordinator.
