Academic Handbook Current Edition MEDI 7058 Multi-sectional and 3D Human Anatomy Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401320 Coordinator James Nol Opens in new window Description This subject includes detailed 3D high resolution multi-sectional anatomy of the human body. Learning human anatomy in a 3D high resolution platform will enable students to conceptualise biological organs in 3D. Students will develop the ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal anatomy as well as understanding the demographics of pathological lesions in their daily clinical works.  Delivered online, students will have opportunities to interact with medical imaging specialists as well as other subspecialists, such as surgeons, neurologists, and Emergency Specialists.
