Academic Handbook Current Edition INFS 1015 Systems Analysis and Design (Advanced) Credit Points 10 Coordinator Simi Kamini Bajaj Opens in new window Description Computing graduates must be able to analyse business requirements and propose a design solution to those requirements. This subject equips students with these skills by further developing previously acquired concepts on systems analysis and design. Students are introduced to novel approaches in system development including Structured, Object oriented and Agile. The Systems Development Life Cycle model is employed as the prime approach equipping students with the basic skills required for developing models for analysis, design and implementation approaches to solving information systems problems. Students will engage in authentic real-world projects to understand requirements, analyse, design and develop models and artefacts using several systems development methodologies.
