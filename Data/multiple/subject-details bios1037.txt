Academic Handbook Current Edition BIOS 1037 Human Development and Disease across the Lifespan (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700314 Coordinator Charlise Bennett Opens in new window Description This subject builds on fundamental assumed knowledge of anatomy and physiology and introduces the study of human disease processes or pathophysiology through the framework of human development as a way of examining growth, health and disease at different stages of the lifespan. General concepts underlying human diseases as well as disorders relating to the lifespan will be studied. Developmental changes in physical, cognitive, social, intellectual, perceptual, personality and emotional growth are discussed. Common communicable and non-communicable, acute, chronic and degenerative health conditions are discussed from a pathophysiological, psychosocial and epidemiological perspective, and their impact on the day to day function of individuals and populations is explored. Risk factors for conditions and disease trajectory are explored at individual and society level, as well as the impact of these conditions on individuals, the health system and wider society.
