Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 1021 Concepts in Human Physiology (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700295 Coordinator Anne Bertoldo Opens in new window Description This subject introduces the core concepts and terminology necessary to provide a basic understanding of the physiological responses of the human body using relevant examples. These include the processes of homeostasis, cell-cell interactions and the physical and chemical transport processes that are required to carry out integrated functions. Students will explore these key physiological concepts through practical hands-on experiments and in interactive group work in prac and tutorial classes, respectively. The subject provides the foundation to study the physiology of human organ systems.
