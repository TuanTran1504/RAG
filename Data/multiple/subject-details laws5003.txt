Academic Handbook Current Edition LAWS 5003 International Commercial Conflicts Credit Points 10 Coordinator John Juriansz Opens in new window Description Students will explore real-world scenarios where international commercial disputes arise under the guidance of experts in the fields of building and construction practice. This subject is primarily concerned with how commercial disputes which have connections with more than one country are dealt with by Australian and international courts. Much of the law which provides the framework for the resolution of such disputes is derived from international instruments, including recent Conventions and Regulations which have significantly re-shaped the law in the European Union. This subject considers the jurisdiction of the Australian courts and the recognition and enforcement in Australia of judgments granted by the courts of other countries. Students will analyse both the Brussels I Regulation and the so-called traditional rules, jurisdiction in personam and in rem, anti-suit injunctions and provisional measures. The subject also examines the rules which determine whether Australian law or the law of another country is applicable to a given situation. This examination includes a discussion of choice of law in contract and tort, with particular attention being devoted to the recent Rome I and Rome II Regulations. The subject also includes consideration of international aspects of insolvency and an analysis of the legal aspects of international commercial arbitration. In particular, students will consider the powers of the Australian courts to support or supervise an arbitration; the effect of an arbitration agreement on the jurisdiction of the Australian courts; the law which governs an arbitration agreement and the parties' dispute; and the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitration awards.
