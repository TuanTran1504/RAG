- Western Sydney University Major Code:
- Previous Code:  MT3028.1
- This testamur major is available as an elective major for Bachelor of Medical Science students only.
- This major focuses on human anatomy and physiology in relation to health and disease. You will develop detailed knowledge of how the human body functions, as well as practical skills. Your strong foundation in this discipline area will provide career opportunities in medical research, hospital pathology or medical imaging laboratories, pharmaceutical, medical sales, allied health companies, research and quality control laboratories, or further education, including graduate medicine degrees. Employment can be in other non-scientific areas such as insurance, government, law or publishing where science knowledge is valued. A variety of minors or free electives allow students to design their own learning journey.
- All students must complete 60 credit points of study at Level 3 to meet program requirements.
- NOTE: Students up to end of 2023 - Students will need to select at least 10 credit points of elective study at Level 3 to meet this requirement.
