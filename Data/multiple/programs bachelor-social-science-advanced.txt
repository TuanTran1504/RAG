- This program applies to students who commenced in 2015 or later.
- The Bachelor of Social Science (Advanced) degree is a broadly based, inter-disciplinary three year program offering flexibility and choice within a range of offerings in the social sciences. The degree is available to high-performing students and is comprised of an eight subject social science core, an eight subject social science major, four subjects of advanced study and four electives or an optional international placement. The majors and minors available within the social sciences include: Anthropology, Child and Community, Criminology and Criminal Justice, Geography and Urban Studies, Heritage and Tourism, Peace and Development Studies and Sociology. The advanced subjects that students undertake will complement these areas of study by encouraging students to develop leadership skills, by extending their capacity for critical and creative thinking, and by providing work experience in relevant fields. Students will also be encouraged to develop greater intercultural awareness and understanding through the option of an international placement and will benefit from being mentored by academics in relevant disciplines. The degree allows students to pursue studies in the social sciences that accord with their personal and occupational interests. It seeks to equip students with the interdisciplinary and specialist skills and knowledge, and real world experience that a new graduate would need in order to be competitive in the workforce or to undertake postgraduate study in the social sciences and related disciplines.
