Academic Handbook Current Edition CIVL 2016 Civil and Substructure Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301220 Coordinator Mark Crowley Opens in new window Description This subject provides an overview of civil construction and associated sub-structure works comprising footings, pilings and slabs and the high costs associated with these elements. Through site surveys, site assessments and design proposals students will apply their developing understanding of bulk excavation, site drainage, service mains (electricity, gas, water, sewerage, data), roads and retaining walls to real world examples. Students will also examine public infrastructure such as ports, tunnels, bridges and highways to deepen their knowledge base. Additionally, in order to further understand the high costs involved in sub structure works, students will learn to identify problems faced on sites including rock, chemically-aggressive soils and water-logged sites.
