- Work Integrated Learning (WIL) for international students
- The Bachelor of Tourism and Event Management incorporates one core and one alternate core that incorporate Work Integrated Learning through supervised industry placements. The majority of students will enrol in the domestic  Visitor Economy Professional Placement subject (20 credit points, offered in both Autumn and Spring), which involves approximately 231 hours (which includes placements with an industry host, professional development and workshops), during which time students gain work-ready skills and undertake professional tasks. As an alternative, Bachelor of Tourism and Event Management students are able to enrol in the Social Sciences International Placement units (totalling 40cp), which incorporate a 12-14 week placement (35 hours/week, totalling 420 hours) with a tourism-related host in an international context.
- In both placement subjects, the subject coordinator works closely with placement providers to ensure an equitable quality of workplace supervision. The process of liaison involves site visits and meetings. These meetings allow subject coordinators to discuss:  specific details about the placements, the criteria for accepting students, placement constraints and the required procedures for student engagement and management during their placement (e.g. induction, supervision, evaluation, patterns of work, special requirements). During the placement weeks, the  subject coordinator will engage in one-on-one student supervision and host liaison management (via zoom/Skype for international placements). The placement weeks also include a suite of evaluation processes throughout, including a mid-year and end of year evaluation undertaken by the host provider, and a mid-year review conducted by the  subject coordinator (either online or face-to-face).
