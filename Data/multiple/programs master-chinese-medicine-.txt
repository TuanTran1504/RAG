- There is an exchange agreement with BUCM, a 4-week clinical placement in specialty is built into the program for the clinical pathway (1.5 year). This is part of subject CMPL 7010 (401133) 20cp Clinical Placement. subject documents, onsite visit by the subject coordinator and specific personnel assigned by the partner institute are in place for assuring quality of supervision.
- Furthermore, an Intention to RENEW an International Agreement has been submitted to extend the current exchange agreement with BUCM to also include a 4-week clinical placement specialty into the 2 year Master of Chinese Medicine for the research and clinical pathways. For the research pathway this is to integrate research into practice.
