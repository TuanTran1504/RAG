- How can you turn your creative play or side-hustle into a business? How can your community, board or organisation ideate, strategise and innovate for better, more creative outcomes and impact? This trans-disciplinary minor offers any WSU student an opportunity to expand their creative practice for existing and emerging industry contexts. Learn to ideate and co-design creative solutions and apply human centred design and creative practice, in the contexts of citizenship, stakeholders, environmental and intercultural competencies. Explore the roles of strategy in developing your professional identity and networks, including through a work placement experience. Develop the strategic mindset, skills and tools to succeed in new economic and social modes of uncertainty and complexity; and design and implement holistic and strategic problem solving and communications. Get to grips with innovation by working across sectors from community to research environments and by designing creative solutions for emerging entrepreneurship opportunities. Understand key tools such as project management, design innovation and innovative and emerging business models, and work in a start-up space.
