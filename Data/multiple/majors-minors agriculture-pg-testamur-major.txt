- Increasing the sustainable production of food for a growing population, in an unpredictable and increasingly harsh environment, is a global priority. Agricultural systems that meet these social and environmental goals of sustainable development must be developed to ensure healthy lives. This postgraduate major is designed for science graduates interested in agricultural careers in technological innovation, research and development, agricultural policy and senior management. It is expected that upon completion of the major students will have the cognitive, technical and critical thinking skills to analyse issues and articulate appropriate solutions in the ever-evolving field of agricultural science. A capstone subject involving either a research or professional industry project will allow students to integrate their knowledge and skills developed throughout the program.
