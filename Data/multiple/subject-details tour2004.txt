Tourism and festival related industries, visitor behaviour, visitor experience and the impacts of these are examined through a socio-cultural lens. Considering tourism as an agent of social change, and festivals as a key driving force within this, the subject is framed within the interplay between tourism, mobility and globalisation, tourism and development, and tourism and world events. The subject will also unpack some of the common motivations for leisure travel, explore the role of tourism in everyday life, and examine the interconnections between the media, consumer culture, visual culture and the tourist and festival experience.
