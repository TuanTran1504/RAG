Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 1020 Fundamentals of Mechanics (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700023 Coordinator Ben Kelley Opens in new window Description This subject deals with the action and interaction of forces, moments and couples in two and three dimensions, on machine elements and simple structures.  It examines the equilibrium of single bodies, of multi-body structures and of mechanisms.  It then covers the dynamics of a particle.  A systematic approach to solving practical engineering design problems is provided.  The subject makes extensive use of vector algebra.
