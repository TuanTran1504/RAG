Academic Handbook Current Edition DESN 1010 Graphic Design: Understanding the Principles (WSTC) Credit Points 20 Legacy Code 700193 Coordinator Ben Fletcher Opens in new window Description This subject introduces students to the fundamental principles of visual language and graphic design practice.  Through a series of workshops, exercises and project briefs, students will learn how elements such as colour, composition, text, typography and image can be used to communicate meaning in a variety of contexts.  Through the project briefs, students will begin to develop awareness of graphic design as a problem solving activity and apply their understanding of the design process in relation to research skills, idea generation, reflective practice and both written and verbal communication skills.  Students will learn the importance of prototyping, developing and refining their ideas through practice and aspects of the digital print production process will also be introduced.  Students will be introduced to design software packages and to support the ongoing development of their digital media skills they will be provided with access to resources for independent online learning.
