Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 3056 Islam in the West Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 101822 Coordinator Jan Ali Opens in new window Description The subject focuses on the question of Muslim presence in the West with reference to the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion. Its aim is to enable students to look at the question of Muslim presence in terms of an action-reaction phenomenon in which different outlooks, ideas, institutions and nodes of information and authenticity interact to create an environment in which identities are developed. These identities then go on to shape the cooperative and conflictual relationships between different subsections of Muslim minorities and the majority non-Muslim Western states and societies. While focusing on the contemporaneity of the question, the subject looks at the study of Muslim presence in the West in a socio-historical context by providing an understanding of how Muslim-Western contacts shaped the nature of their relationship in the past. Then, the subject looks to contrasting the changes before and after 9/11 with reference to a set of ideas, institutions and contexts.
