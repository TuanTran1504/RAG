Academic Handbook Current Edition ARCH 2001 Architecture Studio -  Fundamentals of Analogue Design Credit Points 20 Legacy Code 301197 Coordinator Ursa Komac Opens in new window Description This subject will introduce students to fundamentals of spatial composition as it relates to visual and temporal experience in architectural contexts. Project-based assessments will involve the creation of 2D and 3D compositions that explore traditional organisational strategies, classical principles of geometry, materiality, experiential phenomena, and representation. Students will work with analogue and traditional tools including freehand drawing and conventional shop equipment.  The subject will also provide an introduction to the history, theory, and discourse of architecture from 4000BC to the Enlightenment.

Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Establish a basic foundation of visual, spatial, and material literacy through iterative studio-based explorations in 2D and 3D composition, aesthetics, and abstraction that relate to human ergonomic scale, functionality, user experience, and context.
Develop abilities for inquiry, organization, comparison of information, editing, diagramming, critical observation and reflection in support of design investigations.
Design and develop proposals through freehand and mechanical drawing techniques, physical model making, verbal and written communication, including ability to form a persuasive and coherent rationale for one�fs work.
Interpret, analyse, and critique important themes from the history and theory of the architecture discipline; including from an Australian, European and Global context of architectural de Subject Content 1. Fundamentals of Spatial and Architectural design
