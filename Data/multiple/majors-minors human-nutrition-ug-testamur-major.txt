- This testamur major is available as an elective major for Bachelor of Science students only.
- A Human Nutrition Major in Medical Science uses biology, chemistry and physiology to develop concepts in food and nutrient form and function in relation to human metabolism and physiology. This major takes students through the ingestion, digestion, absorption, storage and utilisation of proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals and trace elements.  Students learn how these nutrients can be managed with respect to appetite, exercise, health and disease as well as develop a wide range of laboratory and research skills. Students will also develop critical analytical skills to assess and implement recommendations for testing, monitoring and community education.
- All students must complete 60 credit points of study at Level 3 to meet program requirements.
- NOTE: Students up to end of 2023 - Students will need to select at least 10 credit points of elective study at Level 3 to meet this requirement.
