- Previous Code: M1095.1
- This major is restricted to students enrolled in programs Bachelor of Humanitarian and Development Studies, Bachelor of Tourism Management and Diploma in Social Science/Bachelor of Humanitarian and Development Studies. This is an alternate Major program that prepares students with knowledge and skills to critically evaluate and assess social processes, policies, and practices, and articulate the place of humanitarian relief and development assistance. This is achieved through a set of subjects specifically tailored towards Humanitarian Preparedness and Response, providing students with the opportunity to apply skills and knowledge acquired during the first two years of their degree in a ‘real world’ setting through the Social Sciences International Placement suite of subjects. The international placement opportunity requires students to obtain a medical clearance, and a Working with Children check for certain organisations.
