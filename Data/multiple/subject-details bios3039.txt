Academic Handbook Current Edition BIOS 3039 Ecology Credit Points 10 Coordinator Uffe Nielsen Opens in new window Description Humans have long been fascinated by Earthâ€™s astounding diversity of species and ecosystems. Ecology is the science that study the distribution of these species, the controls on population dynamics, and what structures communities and ecosystems. The resulting knowledge is critical to inform land management and policy decision-making to conserve biodiversity, sustainably manage ecosystems, while supporting a growing human population through provision of ecosystem services including food production and adaptation to climate change. In this subject, you will learn current ecological theory from the scale of individual organisms, through populations, to communities and ecosystems; how to conduct ecological research; and, how to apply ecological knowledge to solve real world problems.

Critically analyse how ecological knowledge is gained and how it can be applied.
Contextualise knowledge gaps and design robust research programs to address these. 
Communicate ecological knowledge verbally and in writing using scientific literature to support key statements. 
Work effectively and responsibly in a team. Subject Content Describe ecology as a science, how ecological knowledge is gained, and how ecological knowledge, including Indigenous understanding, and theory informs management and policy decision-making.
Historical and contemporary drivers of the distribution of species.
Population biology and population dynamics, particularly in reference to managing threatened species.
The role of biotic interactions, with a focus on herbivory, predation, competition, and beneficial associations.
Community ecology, particularly how communities change through time and space.
Ecosystem ecology, with a focus on primary productivity, biogeochemical cycling and sustainable land use in the face of global change.
Approaches to, and consequences of, traditional and current management, including Indigenous land use, on species and ecosystems.
