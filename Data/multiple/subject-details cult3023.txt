The subject claims to engage students with current global contexts to integrate professional knowledge and develop skills, attitudes and behaviours that support them to be global citizens with inter-cultural competence. As part of the subject students will be required to undertake an global learning experience relevant to their studies. This experience may involve travel to an overseas organisation and/or community, or participation with a local or online globally focused organisation. The subject is completed across a year of study, with the first semester a preparatory experience, mid-semester the opportunity to complete an global short program, and the final semester a time to reflect. Students will immerse themselves in their new global environment, make sense of the organisation's or a community's modes of action and meaning, and negotiate their ways of acting and being in the process of becoming a member and contributing to the organisation and/or community with which they engage. Students in this subject will reflect on global engagement experiences to discuss self-learning and how this learning informs personal and professional development.
