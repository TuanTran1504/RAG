We will show you how to mobilise your own creative interests, how to identify and research a creative or market challenge, and teach you techniques for generating ideas and innovative solutions-based responses. You'll learn systemic methods and tools for creative ideation across multiple platforms and channels, including UX (user experience), UI (user interactivity), design thinking, IA (information architecture) and UCD (user centred design). We'll also teach you how to pitch your project so it captures the imagination and attention of clients and audiences.
