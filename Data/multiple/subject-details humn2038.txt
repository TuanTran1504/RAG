Pigments of the Imagination challenges the accepted view that there is such a thing as 'race' based on skin colour and that identity is based on it. This subject will encourage students to consider their own definitions of race and explore the view that it is an imaginary concept. Students will examine the various ways race as an imaginary concept permeates our education practices and cultural representations influencing the construction of racially classified positions for Indigenous Australians as well as all Australians. Students will be encouraged, by critically analysing a range of cultural texts to re-imagine Indigenous and Non-Indigenous relations through flipped mode of delivery supported by face to face tutorials.
