Academic Handbook Current Edition BIOS 1014 Cell Biology (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700125 Coordinator Anne Bertoldo Opens in new window Description Cells are the most basic form of all life, and underlying normal cell function are the molecules used to build complex cellular structures, generate energy, and propagate dynamic life.  The subject will study the fundamental processes through which key biomolecules, including lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids and nucleic acids, are manipulated to generate and store energy, and build a broad array of important biological macromolecules including DNA, membranes and proteins.  To sustain life, cells respire for energy and replicate for growth and sexual reproduction.  Accordingly the subject will examine cellular respiration, transcription, translation, mitosis, meiosis, transmission and how the genetic code is inherited and modified providing students insights into the phenomena of life.  The role of DNA technology in the fields of medicine, biomolecular plant and animal science, food, forensic and environmental science will provide students with real world applications.
