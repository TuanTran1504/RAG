Academic Handbook Current Edition BIOS 2014 Functional Proteins and Genes Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300936 Coordinator Patrick O'Doherty Opens in new window Description Biochemistry is the study of the chemistry of life. By understanding the structure and roles of biological macromolecules found in cells students will develop the concept of self assembly of these molecules to form life.  Topics include the structure of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids and how they function in the lipid and aqueous environments of the cell. Basic metabolism is introduced with an overview of the major pathways in cells, mechanisms of regulation, and an introduction into important cofactors and intermediatory molecules.  These concepts will be reinforced through practical classes that teach critical skills in experimental design, analysis and interpretation.
