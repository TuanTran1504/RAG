Academic Handbook Current Edition PUBH 3023 Evidence in Professional Reasoning Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401384 Coordinator Anannya Singharay Opens in new window Description In this subject, you will incorporate the evidence knowledge and skills developed in previous subjects into professional practice. The evidence-based practice process manages expanding and uncertain knowledge by formulating answerable questions, effectively searching literature, critically appraising evidence and applying and evaluating its significance in clinical practice and healthcare decision-making. Professional reasoning requires consideration of best available evidence, client or patient perspectives, professional expertise and practice context. You will learn professional reasoning for shared decision-making and safe and effective communication for patient scenarios relevant to your program.
