Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 1023 Introduction to Physiology Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301353 Coordinator Sabine Piller Opens in new window Description From 2020 this subject replaces 300818 - Introduction to Physiology. This subject introduces the concept of homeostasis and critically examines examples of how the body systems are regulated and homeostatically controlled. The subject uses a body-systems approach to examine the physiology of tissues, organs and systems in order to develop an integrated view of the regulated functioning of the human body.
