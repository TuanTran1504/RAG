Students will have the opportunity to examine implicit and explicit images of childhood and to consider how these images inform how we think and engage with children in our everyday lives; the role they play in the institutions that impact children’s lives and in the disciplines that study children. Images will be drawn from a range of contexts and types of media. Students will also have the opportunity create their own representations of children.
