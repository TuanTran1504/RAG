Academic Handbook Current Edition BLDG 2004 Built Heritage Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301085 Coordinator Mary Hardie Opens in new window Description This subject explores the history of building design in Australia and applies this contextual knowledge to the design of additions to existing buildings, as well as, to infill development in heritage areas. Built form, scale, materials, finishes and streetscape are considered so that new structures complement rather than detract from existing heritage buildings. The appropriateness of preservation, restoration, renovation, retrofit and adaptation strategies for older buildings is examined in the context of market and regulatory constraints on built heritage.
