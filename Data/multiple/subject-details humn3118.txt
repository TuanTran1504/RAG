Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 3118 Indigenous Cultures: A Global Perspective Credit Points 10 Coordinator Donna James Opens in new window Description Drawing on global case studies, this subject aims to introduce students to some of the pressing socio-cultural issues facing indigenous peoples around the world.  The subject examines the complex relationships between globalisation, colonialism and post-colonialism and contemporary indigenous cultures and identities.  It draws attention to the way in which issues of representation, cultural autonomy, cultural commodification, development and human rights play out with respect to indigenous peoplesâ€™ lives.  More specifically, the subject interrogates the power relations and politics central to many of these issues and examines the nature of contemporary indigenous and non-indigenous interactions, particularly in the contexts of tourism and heritage, the cultural industries, the environment, development and urbanisation.
