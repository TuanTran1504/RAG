By using cultural diversity as an analytical lens, students will engage with the broader questions about what it means to be human, how cultures change and adapt and how studies of human diversity can provide answers to many of the challenges of the future. Through case studies, critical analyses and self-reflection students will also examine how key subject themes such as cultural competence, ethnographic inquiry and comparativism are applied in anthropology and other key employment areas for social science and humanities graduates.
