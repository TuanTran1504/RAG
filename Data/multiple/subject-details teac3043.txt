Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 3043 Reading Children's Literature and Digital Texts Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102798 Coordinator Johanna Einfalt Opens in new window Description In this subject students will gain knowledge and understanding about using children's literature and digital texts to teach reading, critical literacy, comprehension, media literacy and how texts convey meaning through choices in language (written) and images (visual). It will explore how children's literature and digital contexts can be used in a K-6 classroom for the teaching of the mechanics of reading, information literacy, comprehension skills (literal, implied, inferential), text design and the social construction of texts. It will develop students deeper understanding of the four resources model of reading and viewing: text decoder, text participant, text user and text analyst. This subject will examine literature experiences and practices in digital environments and the principles of interactivity, connectivity and access that now characterise the reading experience in the digital age. Through the subject, students will be introduced to a language to talk about both written and visual texts by focusing on the meaning making resources used in constructing the texts. This subject is included in the Transition Phase of the Bachelor of Education.
