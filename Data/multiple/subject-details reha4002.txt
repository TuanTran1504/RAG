Academic Handbook Current Edition REHA 4002 Clinical Education C (Ambulatory Care) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401111 Coordinator Amitabh Gupta Opens in new window Description This clinical education placement will operationalise the theoretical and research knowledge and skills learnt in the first three years of the course. Students will be required to assess and treat clients who present in hospital outpatient departments, community settings and private practices. This involves the assessment of the client's impairments, function and disability within their home and community environment. Interventions may include manual and exercise therapy; use of electrophysical agents, taping and bracing; and education regarding both prevention and management of conditions. Assessment and treatment will tend to have a musculoskeletal physiotherapy focus, however, clients may also present with neurological and cardiorespiratory conditions that require intervention. Students will therefore integrate knowledge and skills learnt across all physiotherapy-specific units in their provision of client-centred care as well as draw on their more general knowledge from earlier stages of the course.
