- Physiotherapy is a highly regarded profession and demand for physiotherapists is strong. Physiotherapists work in private practice, aged care settings, private and public hospitals, workplaces, community based agencies, schools, rehabilitation centres and chronic health management clinics. Patients range across the life span, from birth to athletes and the elderly. The program in physiotherapy is offered as a 4-year Bachelor of Physiotherapy. The first three years of the program combine studies in physiotherapy with a broad understanding of biomedicine and health science fields to develop the professional competencies important for ethical and safe practice, high quality care and the skills to work in multidisciplinary teams. The final year focuses predominately on the development of physiotherapy practice skills, which are used during clinical placements to treat patients in the community. Evidence-based practice is one of the most important trends in healthcare today and a strong feature of the program.
- The Honours program is available to high achieving students in the Bachelor of Physiotherapy. Honours is a key early step in the pathway to leadership in the profession and opens up the world of research, without taking any longer to complete the degree. Students apply for entry into the Honours program in year 3 of the combined degree. They begin advanced research training in the latter half of year 3. Clinical placements and an honours thesis are completed during the fourth year of the program. The thesis presents research that addresses real physiotherapy problems. This research will be conducted under the supervision of experienced academic researchers.
