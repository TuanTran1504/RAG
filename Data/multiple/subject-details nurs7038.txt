This subject will provide an overview of the Family Partnership Model. Participants will examine the theoretical framework underlying the model which emphasises the need for highly skilled professional communication to develop supportive and effective relationships with families. Students will participate in 5 interactive webinars to embed the fundamental concepts and skills associated with the model.  Facilitating groups for parents is a key skill of the child and family health professional. In this subject participants will also study how adults learn, and the key skills in understanding and promoting the group process. Working in partnership extends to other professional and agencies, enabling students to develop skills in professional collaboration.
