Academic Handbook Current Edition EART 3001 Biological Adaptation to Climate Change Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300909 Coordinator Justin Welbergen Opens in new window Description This subject investigates how organisms respond to variation in climate and what can be done to reduce their vulnerability to anthropogenic climate change. The subject makes use of a novel conceptual framework that defines 'vulnerability' as a function of the 'exposure' and 'sensitivity' of organisms to climate change. Therefore, we will begin by exploring how organisms are exposed to climate change, from regional climatic changes acting at the scale of populations, to local climatological effects acting at the scale of individuals. Next, we will examine what determines the sensitivity of organisms, focusing on the physiological, behavioural, and life-history traits that affect the ability of organisms to cope with and adapt to climate change. Then, we will show how exposure and sensitivity combine to determine the vulnerability of organisms, including in both managed and natural ecosystems. Finally, we will discuss the 'mitigation' and 'adaptation' strategies that can prevent the worst of the potential impacts from becoming realised and help protect our biodiversity in the face of anthropogenic climate change.

Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Describe how climate change will affect wildlife and ecosystems from local and global perspectives
Explain the significance of historical changes in climate in shaping ecosystems and species radiations
Evaluate climate change exposure at different temporal and spatial (global to microhabitat) scales
Evaluate climate change sensitivity at all levels of biological organisation
Analyse what drives vulnerability of organisms to climate change and what can help reduce impacts
Conduct investigations safely and ethically in the field and laboratory, using sampling methodology correctly to obtain valid data
Use spreadsheets and statistical tools in analytical programs to enter, analyse, and graph data; and use GIS and population modelling tools to draw appropriate conclusions from data
Communicate findings correctly in oral or in written form using an appropriate style, as well as accessing the scientific literature to place the findings in context Subject Content 1. Overview on climate change impacts on biodiversity
