- The Bachelor of Speech Pathology is a four-year full-time degree. Speech pathologists apply their knowledge and skills in areas such as speech, voice, language and swallowing in children and adults to support all individuals’ rights to optimal communication, swallowing and mealtime experiences. Employment is available in diverse settings including private practice, aged care settings, private and public hospitals, community-based agencies, and schools. The first two-years of the course combine evidence-based studies in speech pathology with a broad understanding of biomedical and health sciences, linguistics and psychology, to develop the professional competencies essential for ethical and safe inter-professional practice. The final two years focus on the development of advanced knowledge and skills in speech pathology and clinical practice, which support work integrated learning within a range of community settings.
- The Honours program is available to high achieving students in the Bachelor of Speech Pathology. Honours is a key early step in the pathway to leadership and research within the profession without taking any longer to complete the degree. Students are invited for entry into the Honours program in year three of the combined degree. Students complete an honours thesis during the fourth year of the program, alongside the core units of the Bachelor of Speech Pathology, including clinical placements. The thesis presents research that addresses current and topical speech pathology issues.
