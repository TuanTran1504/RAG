Academic Handbook Current Edition PROC 2003 Materials Selection and Design Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301415 Coordinator Leigh Sheppard Opens in new window Description Materials are a critical point of consideration when designing a solution to a technical problem. However, materials can also be quite complex by themselves and can possess a range of properties which may only partially suit an intended solution. In this unit, students use real world scenarios to learn to make decisions concerning material selection under different circumstances, based upon technical requirements, and balanced against sustainability and cost.
