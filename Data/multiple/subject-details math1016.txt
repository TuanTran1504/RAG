Academic Handbook Current Edition MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200237 Coordinator Leanne Rylands Opens in new window Description This subject is the first of two mathematics subjects to be completed by all students enrolled in an engineering degree during their first year of study. The content covers a number of topics that underpin the later-stage engineering mathematics subjects. The subject matter includes: differential and integral calculus of a single variable, complex numbers, aspects of matrix algebra, vectors, and some elementary statistics and probability theory. The aim of this subject is to introduce a number of key mathematical concepts needed in the study of Engineering, and to provide a solid foundation for the follow-on subject Mathematics for Engineers 2.
