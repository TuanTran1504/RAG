Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 4038 Biomedical Electronics Credit Points 10 Coordinator Gaetano Gargiulo Opens in new window Description This subject will cover recent advances in biomedical electronics including electronic diagnostic devices, implanted devices, human-computer-interface, bioinstrumentation and neuromorphic engineering. Topics covered span from the bio-electromagnetism and related applications to regulatory aspects (IEC standards and TGA/FDA approval processes) and electrical safety of instrumentation. This subject will have a strong practical design focus with laboratories and tutorials focused on the design of real instrumentation (including manufacturing) dealing with real biomedical signals. This subject uses basic and advanced electronic concepts including circuit simulator(s), embedded systems and requires manual assembly of circuits. Recap and catch-up modules to electronics, signal conditioning, advanced mathematics concepts such us Fourier Transform and their application to electronics as well as circuit simulator training and electronic instruments use training are provided, for students from non Electronic/Electrical background.
