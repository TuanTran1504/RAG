Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 800210 Coordinator Anna Denejkina Opens in new window Description The knowledge labour market is tightening as more academics compete for the limited number of permanent and temporary positions available globally.  Early career researchers must quickly adapt to established systems, increased workloads and sometimes stressful and changing work environments. They may be concerned about job security.  The purpose of this subject is to introduce students to the world of academia, to assist them in developing the knowledge and skills required to thrive as early career researchers, and to establish networks that they can leverage in order to gain employment and be successful in their careers. Through an innovative model built on online activities and workshops, students will develop an understanding of the nature of academic work in Australia and around the world in the 21st century. Each student will partner with a mentor to develop time, project and people management skills, as well as mapping out networks to pursue near to and upon completion of the student's Doctoral (HDR) candidature.
