- AQF Level:
- CRICOS Code: 106434D
- This program applies to students who commenced in 2022 or later.
- Handbook Summary 2022-2023
- Neuromorphic Engineering is an exciting inter-disciplinary field combining aspects from electrical engineering, computer science, neuroscience, signal processing and mathematics. The Master of Neuromorphic Engineering offers students an opportunity to partner with high-profile industry partners in an applied project or a research project, mentored by leading researchers from the International Centre for Neuromorphic Systems at the MARCS Institute. This program seeks to address the rapidly growing demand for alternative inter-disciplinary technologies, such as bio-inspired agile sensory systems, smart edge devices, and brain-inspired high performance computational platforms. The students will be introduced to state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware, sensors and algorithms in a highly structured way that increases their acumen for approaching new situations with creativity and initiative.
- All students will enrol in the 8124 Master of Applied Neuromorphic Engineering and have the option to transition to 8123 Master of Neuromorphic Engineering at the end of their first year. A student completing the two-year degree may apply to pursue a PhD. Two exit options (Graduate Certificate in Neuromorphic Engineering and Graduate Diploma in Neuromorphic Engineering) are also available. The part-time offering of the 8124 M Applied Neuromorphic Engineering program is available to local students.
- The majority of the coursework subjects will be undertaken at Parramatta City - Hassall St campus, while the applied project and research project will be located at Penrith campus.

- 8125 - Graduate Diploma in Neuromorphic Engineering
- Part-time start-year intake
- 8126 - Graduate Certificate in Neuromorphic Engineering
- 8125 - Graduate Diploma in Neuromorphic Engineering
- 40 cp subject taken over 2 sessions (20cps each session)
- Note: “Students who have met minimum 4.5 GPA requirements for 8123 Master of Neuromorphic Engineering will be able to transfer to this program and complete ELEC 6002 Master Dissertation in Neuromorphic Engineering (80 credit points) instead of Applied Project in Neuromorphic Engineering (40 credit points).”
- Please note: If student transition to 8123 Master of Neuromorphic Engineering at the end of second year, they will no longer be able to stay in the part-time offering. 8123 M Neuromorphic Engineering is full time only. The ELEC 6002 Master Dissertation in Neuromorphic Engineering subject (80 credit points) can only be completed full-time.
