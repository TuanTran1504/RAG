- Recommended Sequence Current
- This sequence applies to students who commenced in 2023 or later. If you commenced prior to 2023 please refer to the Sequence 2022 tab for details.
- Qualification for this award requires the successful completion of 240 credit points including the subjects listed in the recommended sequence below.
- Full-time
- Midwifery Practice Experience
- To enable students to experience midwifery practice across the calendar year as required by ANMAC, all Midwifery Professional Practice subjects (MPP’s) are offered as ‘H’ subjects. The major types of experiences are in blocks of learning and in a woman-centred continuity of care model. Practice experiences for the Bachelor of Midwifery are documented within the practice subjects.
- Practice Block
- A number of practice experiences, in a variety of practice placements, are scheduled throughout the three year program. There are fewer hours of clinical practice in first year (approximately 25%) compared to second year (50%), with the most clinical practice allocated to the third year (75%) to enable students to consolidate their practice in readiness to meet the NMBA Competencies for practice as a midwife.
- This practice occurs in blocks of time (from one day a week to five days per week) and includes working in hospital areas such as antenatal clinics; antenatal wards; birthing subjects; postnatal wards; newborn nursery; postnatal home visiting; operating theatres for caesarean sections; ultrasound clinics; fetal and maternal assessment subjects and gynaecology wards. The practice also includes working in such areas as community centres with child and family nurses; midwives in group practice; rural hospitals; and ambulance services.
- Continuity of Care
- Continuity of care/carer enables women to develop a relationship with the same caregiver(s) throughout pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period. Continuity of care/carer facilitates relationships and consistent information, which is essential to the provision of care that is safe, sensitive and appropriate. Students undertaking this program will be introduced to the theoretical concepts and evidence base for continuity of care/carer model within the Midwifery Knowledge subjects. Continuity of care/carer experience will be gained within the Midwifery Practice Experience subjects. Throughout the program, students will refine and develop their understanding of continuity of care/carer, underpinned by a woman-centred care philosophy, where women are involved in their own care, making informed choices and having control over both their care and their relationships with their caregivers. In this relationship-based care model, women report a higher level of satisfaction compared to other care models (Sandall, Soltani, Gates, Shennan & Devane, 2016). Students will follow 10 women over the course of the BMid within this model of care; two women in the first year, three in the second year and five in the third year.
- Students will begin their first midwifery practice placement within eight weeks of commencing the program in the Autumn semester or as soon as they have met all the pre-requisites. Students will attend well women’s antenatal clinics on a weekly basis and begin by observing the practice of midwifery care. They will practice their midwifery skills on campus and as they gain confidence they will begin to have more a ‘hands on’ approach under the supervision of a midwife. During the antenatal clinic placements it is expected that students will meet and work in partnership with women in the continuity of care model. Students will follow the women throughout their pregnancy, labour and birth and during the postnatal period for up six weeks as determined by the woman, and the supervising midwife. This may include visits to the woman’s home.
- The practice blocks, together with the 10 continuity of care experiences across the calendar year, provide the BMid curriculum with approximately fifty percent clinical practice and fifty percent theory, which is a requirement of ANMAC.
