- The Bachelor of Engineering Science (BEngSc) is a three-year degree program with common first year structure. Students have the opportunity to focus on a discipline area by selecting a Major in Advanced Manufacturing, Civil, Construction, Electrical, Materials, Mechanical, Robotics & Mechatronics, and Sustainability engineering. The program has been developed with the view of enabling graduates to practice as an engineering technologist in their chosen field. The three-year BEngSc program may be used as a pathway to the four-year Bachelor of Engineering program that meets Engineers Australia professional accreditation requirements; an academic performance criteria will be the eligibility criteria for such a transfer.
- This program is taught at the Parramatta City - Hassall Street campus.
- Study Mode
- Three years full-time or six years part-time.

- Penrith, Parramatta and Sydney City Campuses
- All students undertaking the Bachelor of Engineering Science are required to enrol in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary.  Students with advanced mathematical skills (band 6 in Advanced Maths or a good grade in Extension Maths or equivalent) may take a readiness test at the start of semester to determine if they are ready for direct entry to MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1. This test is a mathematics aptitude test, students with the requisite skills should not need to study for it.
- MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary
- MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1
- Students who pass the readiness test will have their enrolment transferred to MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1 by the School.
- MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1
- Students remaining in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary will be required to complete MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1 during second semester and will be encouraged to complete MATH 1019 Mathematics for Engineers 2 during the Summer session.
