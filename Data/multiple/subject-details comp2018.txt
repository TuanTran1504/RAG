Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 2018 Simulation Fundamentals Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301167 Coordinator Ante Prodan Opens in new window Description In the last couple of decades computer modelling and simulation has evolved into an important discipline used in nearly every aspect of life from computer games to banking. What was once a tool for training pilots is now a capability to better understand human behaviour, enterprise systems, disease proliferation, and much more. This is an introductory, problem-based unit, where students will learn by doing.  Students will acquire ability to use different simulation methodologies and tools such as InsightMaker and AnyLogic to build new insights into the world around you and learn how to share these insights effectively with others.
