Academic Handbook Current Edition BLDG 1016 Building Science (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700308 Coordinator Robert Paluzzano Opens in new window Description This subject provides students with an introductory overview of the way in which scientific principles impact on the structure, fabric and performance of the built environment. Areas covered will include the concepts of force, energy and work in building structures; properties of common building materials; and significant aspects of heat, light and sound in buildings. All the theoretical content will be contextualised within examples drawn from the construction industry. Students will be able to recognise the critical data required for practical decision-making in the area of building technology.
