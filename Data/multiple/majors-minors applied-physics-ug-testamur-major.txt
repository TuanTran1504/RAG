- Western Sydney University Major Code:
- Previous Code:  MT3047.1
- This major is available as an elective in Bachelor of Science 3754, and an elective major option in Bachelor of Medical Science 3755. See the related programs tab for more information.
- Please note, the BSc Major Environmental Health T076, BSc Adv 3757, Bachelor of Science (Pathway to Teaching Primary/Secondary) 3756 & BMedSc Adv 3758, do not have sufficient Flexible space to accommodate a second/elective Major.
- Applied Physics uses the principles and tools of physics to understand and manipulate the world around us, and covers fields as diverse as astrophysics, biophysics, magnetic resonance (i.e., NMR and MRI), medical physics, remote sensing, semiconductor physics, space science and much more. In this major, the core principles of physics, mathematics and computing are taught and used to study specific applications of physics. Students have access to world class facilities (e.g, telescopes and onsite ultra-high field MRI), and the expertise of international researchers. Graduates of this major possess skills in problem-solving and critical thinking together with deep knowledge of Physics. This flexible set of skills, applied across many disciplines, enables students to seek career opportunities confidently in teaching, research or industry, in diverse fields such as medical physics, materials science, energy, geoscience, aerospace, data science, finance and more.
