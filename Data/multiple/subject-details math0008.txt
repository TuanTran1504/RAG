Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Select and apply a variety of algebraic techniques to solve equations and problems.
Use the concept of a function and the relationship between dependent and independent variables to solve a variety of problems both algebraically and graphically. 
Solve geometric and trigonometric problems that involve two- and three-dimensional objects.
Apply a variety of strategies to find mathematical models for problems involving exponential and logarithmic functions. 
Use algebra to solve geometrical problems in Cartesian and polar coordinate systems. Subject Content 1. Basic arithmetic operations (with whole numbers, fractions and decimals, index numbers, units and measurements)
2. Basic algebra (terminology, simplifying algebraic expressions, expanding and factorising, working with algebraic fractions, solving linear and quadratic equations, substituting into formulae and changing the subject, simultaneous equations)
3. Functions (terminology and notation, domain and range, graphs of functions, composite functions, inverse functions, elementary functions (linear, quadratics, exponential and logarithmic.))
4. Geometry (angles, triangles, rectangles, circles, Pythagoras Theorem, areas and volumes)
5. Trigonometry (basic trigonometric ratios, exact ratios, complementary angles, angles of any magnitude, sine and cosine rule, trigonometric functions and their graphs)
6. Coordinate geometry (Cartesian coordinate system, distance between two points, equation of a straight line, gradient of a line, distance of a point from a line, loci, equation of a circle, polar coordinates, Pythagoras Theorem in 3D)
