The subject is delivered online with students accessing learning modules and connecting with their learner community in their own time and at their own pace to allow maximum flexibility. 

At the beginning of the subject students use diagnostic tools to identify their specific strengths and areas for improvement, and develop an individualised learning journey through the content. This learning journey will help to address individual study skill needs, while also developing employability skills, facilitating connection with peers and with the University community, as well as the studentâ€™s future career.
