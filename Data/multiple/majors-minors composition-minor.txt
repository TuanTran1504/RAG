- Please note: this minor is available only to students enrolled in programs 1659 Bachelor of Music, 1738 Bachelor of Music (Dean's Scholars) and 1841 Bachelor of Music/Bachelor of Creative Industries.
- Composition develops the creative voice of the composer as distinctive within industry contexts and eclectic in its skill basis and cultural/genre engagement. It does this through developing creative voice awareness, wide contemporary notated composition skills, orchestration and songwriting abilities, as well as improvisation techniques, intercultural awareness, interdisciplinary readiness and collaborative abilities. Collaborative skills are developed including: composer-performer interactivity skills, and songwriting/composition collaborative abilities (lyricists, visual media, dance). Other skills developed include: industry-style pitching abilities, studio sound recording, and screen media production skills. Reflective-practice writing skills are honed to identify and resource creativity, including personal creative voice, with intercultural and global, Australian indigenous, and sustainability hybridities.
