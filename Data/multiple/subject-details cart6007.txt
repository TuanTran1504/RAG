Academic Handbook Current Edition CART 6007 Writing and Genre Credit Points 10 Coordinator Mette Jakobsen Opens in new window Description In this subject, students engage with the conventions of genre writing, including (but not limited to) crime, fantasy, romance, historical and/or speculative fiction. Students will study a range of genre texts as a jumping-off point for their own work, gaining experience in the conventions of different genres as a pathway to producing a longer work in a chosen genre and form. The class includes collective workshopping and discussion with peers about drafts of written work. Studentsâ€™ work for final assessments will demonstrate both an understanding of the conventions of a chosen genre and a willingness to challenge and extend them.
