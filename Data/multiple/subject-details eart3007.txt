Academic Handbook Current Edition EART 3007 Land Degradation and Contamination Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301273 Coordinator Jason Reynolds Opens in new window Description This subject will examine current interdisciplinary topics on land degradation and contamination in both urban, peri-urbanand rural environments. The effects of the various human induced land degradation and contamination processes and pollutants in terrestrial environments will be explored and how impacts can be ameliorated and managed. The focus is on both the science of environmental pollutants and on the remediation strategies currently available. Topics include; basic concepts of soils, study of the processes, common soil pollutants, persistent organic contaminants and pesticides, acidification of soils, quantitative risk assessment, land reclamation, and landfill sites School Science Discipline Soil Science Student Contribution Band HECS Band 2 10cp Check your fees via the Fees page.
