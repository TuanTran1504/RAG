Academic Handbook Current Edition CHEM 1003 Essential Chemistry 1 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300800 Coordinator Janice Aldrich-Wright Opens in new window Description This subject provides an introduction to some of the essential knowledge, concepts and skills of chemistry, to serve the needs of students majoring in chemistry and those requiring a working knowledge of chemistry. Observable chemical facts and phenomena including structure, dynamics, and energetics, are explained in terms of current mathematical and visual models and further developed in Essential Chemistry 2. Evidence for chemical understanding is provided using IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and computer molecular modelling. Laboratory skills relate theory to practice through the development of practical skills required to determine the concentration of an analyte using volumetric and spectrophotometric analysis.

Learning Outcomes Explain chemistry concepts accurately, clearly, and concisely, using an appropriate combination of everyday language with correct spelling and grammar; specialist chemical terms and notation; mathematics (equations, graphs); molecular-level representations; and labelled diagrams
Demonstrate competence in the manipulative laboratory skills and deductive skills involved in volumetric, spectrophotometric, and qualitative analysis
Calculate quantities using mathematical formulas, and expressing them with the appropriate number of significant figures, and in some cases, uncertainty
Describe an atom's chemical �epersonality�f by relating its position in the Periodic Table to its electron configuration, and ratio of effective nuclear charge Zeff, to average distance r of the valence electrons from the nucleus
Predict the physical properties of a substance based on its classification as a metal, ionic compound, molecular substance, or network substance and the types of intra- and intermolecular bonding involved.
Explain how IR spectra and data from mass spectrometry provide experimental evidence for the composition, connectivity (which atoms are bonded together), and formula for a compound.
Identify a reaction as an example of a Lewis acid-base reaction (complexation or proton exchange) or a redox reaction (electron exchange), identify the donors and acceptors, express the extent of reaction quantitatively in terms of the reaction quotient, Q, and predict the direction of reaction from the difference between Q and t Subject Content Prescribed Texts Structures that include subject Chemical Sciences (CHEM)
