This subject focuses on how biology has been enhanced through advances in technology, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics in the development of cell phenotype. Using model systems, this subject shows how research biologists use computational cell biology to form hypotheses, mine data, analyse experiments, and synthesise information. Students will apply bioinformatics and engage with next-generation DNA sequencing data. Students will apply web-based bioinformatics toolkits to construct and compare model genomes, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome information to profile cell genotype and phenotype. Students will undertake a project that interprets and communicates research findings in the context of real world applications, legal and ethical frameworks.
