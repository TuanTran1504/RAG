Academic Handbook Current Edition RADI 7002 Practice of Cardiac Sonography 1 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401189 Coordinator Paul Stoodley Opens in new window Description In this subject, students will learn how to acquire and optimise ultrasound images and to make key measurements. They will learn to draw conclusions about cardiac anatomy and function based on images and measurements and will develop their professional and ethical skills by learning how to plan and implement a cardiac ultrasound scan in a safe and ethical manner. The skills and knowledge learnt in this subject, which includes a work-integrated learning component, provide foundational skills in cardiac sonography.

For students who complete their clinical training in a NSW public hospital, the necessary legislative requirements will be part of their employment conditions. Clinical training for many of the students will be in a private setting, where the necessary requirements (which are likely to differ from public institutions) will be addressed as needed. Training for some students will occur in locations other than NSW (where legislative requirements can be competed if, and when required). Special Requirements - NSW Health Legislative Prerequisites Pre-requisites Student Compliance Information for all Health-Related Placements Prior to enrolling in this subject, students must have submitted a Student Undertaking Form and undertake to apply for a National Police Check, which is required to be submitted before placement, and a Working with Children Check Student Declaration.
