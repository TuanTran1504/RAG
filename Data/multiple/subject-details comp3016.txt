Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 3016 Operating Systems Programming (Advanced) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300943 Coordinator Evan Crawford Opens in new window Description This subject provides the knowledge of the internal structure and functionality of Operating Systems. Through the use of case studies the abstraction that Operating Systems provide will be investigated, and techniques for programming with these abstractions will be developed.

discuss operating systems fundamental concepts: process, process synchronisation, process scheduling and dispatch, memory management, virtual memory, I/O system management, file systems, hierarchical directory systems;
identify some of the performance issues involved, and carry out calculations in this regard;
identify the central role of concurrency in operating systems programming; and solve problems requiring concurrency;
write programs illustrating the application of the theoretical concepts, and explore these concepts in a simulated and actual environments;
analyze and evaluate an operating systems suitability for a task based on requirement. Subject Content Interface with the operating system: general properties and style of system calls; operating system structures, and how they can be accessed;
Process and thread concept, management, synchronisation, scheduling and the realisation of these in modern operating systems.
