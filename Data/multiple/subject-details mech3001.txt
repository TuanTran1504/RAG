It discusses the fundamental principles in controlling mechanical dynamic systems.  In particular, the subject will cover contents in: multi-degree of freedom vibration analysis and modelling; open and closed loop systems; transfer function and state variable methods in mechanical system modelling; concepts of stability;  design and analyse control systems using root-locus, bode diagram and state-space methods for mechanical systems.
