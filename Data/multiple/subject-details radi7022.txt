Academic Handbook Current Edition RADI 7022 Practice of Obstetric and Gynecological (O&G) Sonography 4 Credit Points 10 Coordinator Catherine Robinson Opens in new window Description In this subject, students will polish their image acquisition, optimisation and measurement skills and learn to perform extended O&G examinations. They will learn to differentiate normal from abnormal anatomical and physiological features by appraising acquired images of fetal anomalies and female pelvic pathologies. Students will strengthen their professional communication skills and ethical attributes by exploring methods for dissemination information and providing high quality patient care. They will reflect on personal sonography practice to enhance clinical skills and plan for further professional development. The subject, which includes a work-integrated learning component, will confirm their professional skills, knowledge and attributes.

For students who complete their clinical training in a NSW public hospital, the necessary legislative requirements will be part of their employment conditions. Clinical training for many of the students will be in a private setting, where the necessary requirements (which are likely to differ from public institutions) will be addressed as needed. Training for some students will occur in states other than NSW (where legislative requirements can be competed if, and when required).
