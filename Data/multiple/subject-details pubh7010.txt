Academic Handbook Current Edition PUBH 7010 Epidemiology of Non-Communicable Diseases Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401174 Coordinator Kate Mcbride Opens in new window Description This subject will document the fundamental concepts in epidemiology and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), common research methods used in NCD epidemiology, and unique applications of these methods in key NCD areas, including reproductive epidemiology, behavioural epidemiology, epidemiology of ageing and epidemiology of specific NCDs (including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, musculoskeletal problems and mental health problems). The principal goals of this subject are to provide a broad overview of the field, and to develop the knowledge and skills needed to (i) critically evaluate published research in NCD epidemiology and (ii) design an epidemiological study to address an NCD topic.
