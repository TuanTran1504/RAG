Academic Handbook Current Edition PUBH 1013 Health Promotion Theory and Approaches (UG Cert) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 500059 Coordinator Maria Dent Opens in new window Description Health promotion is a process that seeks to enable individuals, communities and populations to increase control over their health. It does so by addressing the determinants of health and equity issues, in addition to providing individuals and communities with the skills and knowledge to make healthy lifestyle choices and to improve health outcomes. Theoretical underpinnings of the various approaches to health promotion are explored in this unit. In addition, factors that enhance and limit health promotion are analysed in conjunction with bigger picture approaches of working with policy. The evidence-based practice for health promotion is outlined together with the need to move beyond education. Approaches to health promotion at the individual, community and population level are explored, including particular considerations for working with Indigenous people.
