- This program applies to students who commenced in 2022 or later.
- Students should follow the program structure for the session start date relevant to the year they commenced.
- For commencement Year 2019 - please refer to 4758.1 - Doctor of Medicine
- For Commencement Year 2018 - please refer to 4641.7 Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery
- The Bachelor of Clinical Science (Medicine)/Doctor of Medicine prepares you to be a doctor who can work safely, competently and effectively across the continuum of medical practice and to enter training in any medical specialty. You will learn through experience and immersion in a broad range of hospital and community-based services throughout the five-year program. From the first weeks, you will learn from real patients, supported by small group collaborative learning at the bedside and on campus. In the first two years, you will learn to apply the biomedical sciences to clinical problems, acquire and practice clinical and research skills. With guidance, you will build your personal learning journey by creating a portfolio of evidence of your learning. After second year, students with a passion for research may choose to do an additional year to gain the Bachelor of Medical Research.
- Third year is the first major clinical year of the Bachelor of Clinical Science (Medicine)/Doctor of Medicine.  Students will apply and extend the knowledge and skills gained in previous subjects undertaking clinical and community placement rotations throughout the Campbelltown, Blacktown/Mt Druitt, Bankstown, Fairfield and Liverpool hospitals, and a variety of community organisations throughout the Greater Western Sydney region and rural NSW.
- In fourth and fifth year, students continue to extend on clinical knowledge and skills through placements in specialty and subspecialty medicine, within a range of settings across metropolitan hospitals, general practice and Aboriginal medical services in rural and remote areas. These placements may be held in hospitals and community-based service organisations in the Greater Western Sydney area, or as rural placements across NSW.
- Students will have the opportunity to undertake a minimum of 12 months of study at one of our rural clinical schools, based at Bathurst and Lismore, where subsidised accommodation is available. In the event of there being a shortfall of students volunteering to undertake such rural placements, students will be allocated until the rural placements are filled.
- During this final phase, you will complete your project and portfolio to graduate with Bachelor of Clinical Science (Medicine)/Doctor of Medicine.
- Early Exit
- Students may exit this program on completion of 240 credit points with a 4759 Bachelor of Clinical Science (Medicine) (exit only)
- Study Mode
- Five years full-time.

- Work Integrated Learning
- International students should also refer to the link below for more information and a link to the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS).
- Work Integrated Learning (WIL) for international students
- AMC accreditation standards require that medical programs provide minimum of clinical placement hours to ensure graduate readiness for supervised medical practice. The current Western Sydney MD meets and exceeds these requirements as well as offering community engaged experiences in GWS, rural community services and in Aboriginal Medical Services across NSW. The MD will provide the same number of weeks and hours in clinical and community placements, and in addition, scaffold and integrate this learning through the use of a longitudinal Professional Portfolio.
- Quality of supervision, including workplace-based teaching, supervision of informal learning and assessment are also mandated by AMC accreditation standards. The MD procedures and policies are regularly reviewed, and improved where necessary. Some of these arrangements include:
- (1) Clinical School staff in each major clinical school site to make direct contact with and liaise with health service management and clinical supervisors on the ground
- (2) Targeted recruitment and selection of clinical placements and supervisors, ongoing support and training through strategies such as face to face workshops and forums, and recognition through conjoint appointments and teaching awards
- (3) Regular distribution of information about curriculum requirements and use of common assessment tools, assessor calibration and training resources
- (4) Collection and analysis of evaluation data from students and teachers, implementation of improvements where necessary
- (5) Collection and comparison of assessment data across teaching sites and student cohorts
- (6) Regular meetings and communication between the School leadership and curriculum coordinators, health and community service leadership and  managers, formal contractual arrangements
