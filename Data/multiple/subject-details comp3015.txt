Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 3015 Operating Systems Programming Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300698 Coordinator Evan Crawford Opens in new window Description This subject provides the knowledge of the internal structure and functionality of Operating Systems.  An operating system defines an abstraction of hardware behavior and provides a range of services more suitable for ICT application development than what raw hardware could deliver, in terms of convenience, efficiency and security. It is important that ICT Professionals have some understanding of how these services are realized. For ICT Professionals whose role includes supporting the operating system this subject provides the introduction to the relevant theory and practice.

Learning Outcomes identify the functions, services and basic structure of operating systems, and describe their role in a computer system;
discuss operating systems fundamental concepts: process, process synchronisation, process scheduling and dispatch, memory management, virtual memory, I/O system management, file systems, hierarchical directory systems;
identify some of the performance issues involved, and carry out elementary calculations in this regard;
identify the central role of concurrency in operating systems programming; and solve relatively simple problems requiring concurrency
write programs illustrating the application of the theoretical concepts, and explore these concepts in a simulated environment;
analyze and evaluate an operating systems suitability for a task based on requirement. Subject Content Assessment The following table summarises the standard assessment tasks for this subject.
