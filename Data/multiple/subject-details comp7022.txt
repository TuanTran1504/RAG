Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 7022 Natural Language Processing Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301313 Coordinator Manas Patra Opens in new window Description Natural Language Processing involves machine reading comprehension and the technologies using it are becoming increasingly widespread. This subject provides a foundation in using the Natural Language Toolkit, which is a leading platform for building Python programs working with 'human language' data, as well as an introduction to Python for Natural Language Processing. Students will use algorithms and explore accessing text corpora and processing raw text; categorising words and classifying text; understanding information from text and analysing sentence structures; and understanding semantic meanings of sentences. Students also gain real-world hands-on experience with Natural Language Processing through the practical tasks and assignments.
