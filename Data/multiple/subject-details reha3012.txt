Academic Handbook Current Edition REHA 3012 Exercise in Musculo-Skeletal Rehabilitation Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400902 Coordinator Paul Marshall Opens in new window Description In 2017, this subject is repalced by 401144 - Exercise Prescription II. This subject focuses on the role of exercise in the functional rehabilitation of musculoskeletal injuries including work and sporting injuries.  It covers injury and re-injury prevention strategies; mechanisms of injury; patho-physiology of injury and repair process; design and evaluation of rehabilitation exercise programs; how the exercise program functions in concert with other methods of injury treatment and management; important pharmacological, communication, psychosocial and cultural considerations; the role of the exercise physiologist in the rehabilitation team; the effects of nervous system disorders and injury on skeletal muscle control, injury and rehabilitation are also considered.
