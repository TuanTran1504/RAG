Academic Handbook Current Edition ELEC 2016 Mathematics for Software Engineers Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301344 Coordinator Stephen Weissenhofer Opens in new window Description This subject will be offered at Engineering Innovation Hub - Hassall St, Parramatta campus.  This subject builds on two maths components begun in first year engineering, which are Finite Maths and Statistics. For Finite Maths, the aim is for students to learn about the ideas in Number Theory, the theory of finite fields, cryptography and Algebraic Coding Theory as techniques for organising information and analysing it. For Statistics, the aim is to learn the various ways in which random variation arises in engineering contexts and apply methods and models for understanding data and making decisions. In both components, students will expand their skills in analytic thinking and making sense of data.
