Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 7149 Understanding and Teaching Children Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102077 Coordinator Stacey Lumsden Opens in new window Description From 2024, this subject is replaced by TEAC 7161 - Educational Psychology for Learning and Teaching. From 2020 students should note that core subjects are now taught in semesters rather than half yearly sessions. This subject is designed to facilitate prospective teachers to develop the dispositions and critical skills to create learning communities that are academically challenging, developmentally responsive, socially equitable and promote social and emotional wellbeing. The subject highlights the interacting contributions of biology and environment to the development of children and explores how teachers' knowledge of this process informs their instructional strategies.  Specifically, this subject examines a body of classic, as well as current theories, research and practice relating to the cognitive, physiological, and social/affective needs of children and focuses on the relevance of these for classroom practice.  Particular emphasis is given to developing responsive teaching practices which promote social and emotional wellbeing of children and are underpinned by high-quality relationships which extend to include the valuing of families and the wider community.
