Academic Handbook Current Edition WELF 3001 Child Abuse as a Social Issue Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 101381 Coordinator Samia Michail Opens in new window Description This subject enables students to examine the way in which child abuse has become a public issue. It considers the assumptions, values and interests which underlie definitions of abuse as well as intervention and prevention strategies promoted to protect children from abuse. In order to do this, students will examine constructions of childhood, the positioning of children and attitudes towards children and families. They will explore the various responses to child abuse in contemporary systems, policies and practices that work to address child abuse.  Students will develop the skills required to ensure that children are active participants in decisions made for their protection.
