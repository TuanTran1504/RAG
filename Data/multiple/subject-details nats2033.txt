The subject will focus on distinct functions of organelles/cellular structures, the relevant mechanisms involved, and the broader role of such functions in a whole cell context.  The subject will encompass a detailed study of cellular components including: the nucleus, ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, the plasma and organellar membranes, mitochondria, peroxisomes and the cytoskeleton. This subject will also investigate how organellar function is relevant to an appropriately functioning cell, and how cell dysfunction impacts the cell and leads to disease. The subject covers contemporary techniques used to study cells including: cell culture, advanced cell imaging, a range of investigative and analysis techniques, and additional experimental approaches enabling thorough understanding of the incredibly fascinating yet complex nature of cells.
