Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 3020 Social Web Analytics Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300958 Coordinator Gizem Intepe Opens in new window Description The Social Web provides everyone with a voice; information from Facebook, Twitter and other social networks allows us to identify trends and relationships in society. Whilst this has interest on a personal level, the killer-apps will be in analysing social Web data for business, such as tracking the buzz around a new product, and understanding the relationships between customers and products. This subject will introduce its students to the Social Web data that is available, and blend data science and machine learning concepts to allow extraction and analysis of such data.
