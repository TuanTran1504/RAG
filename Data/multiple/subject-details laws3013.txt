Conflict of Laws issues may arise between the Australian States and Territories or between nations.  The globalisation of economic activity, and ease and affordability of travel and telecommunications have contributed to the recent dramatic increase of trans-national dimensions in personal and commercial litigation.  This subject provides an introduction to the sources of conflict of laws, the international jurisdiction of domestic courts, the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgements and decrees, and the problem of choice of law as it arises in various situations.
