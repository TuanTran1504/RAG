Academic Handbook Current Edition RADI 7007 Principles of Cardiac Sonography 2 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401186 Coordinator Paul Stoodley Opens in new window Description This subject will build on the knowledge acquired in Principles of Cardiac Sonography 1, via a blend of theoretical and practical activities. The students' understanding of cardiac anatomy and physiology will be extended, and they will begin studying cardiovascular diseases. Aspects of ultrasound physics studied in this subject include identifying imaging artifacts, recognizing equipment limitations, and bio-effects and safety.
