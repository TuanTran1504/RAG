Academic Handbook Current Edition REHA 3010 Exercise for Health and Disease Prevention Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401145 Coordinator Bobby Cheema Opens in new window Description This subject emphasises teaching students to design safe and effective exercise programs for optimal health, well-being, and the prevention of major chronic diseases.  Holistic recovery strategies, including sleep, nutrition and stress-reduction are also explored. Students will learn about the aetiology of major chronic diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular disease, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases and mental illnesses, and how these conditions can be targeted with exercise.  Students will also develop the practical skills necessary for screening and testing populations at-risk and with chronic diseases.
