- Infectious diseases are a major threat to health across the globe, including increasing threats from new pathogens and the emergence of antibiotic resistance in established pathogens. This minor will examine organisms that typically cause infectious disease and will deliver skills and knowledge on how these interact with the immune system, cause disease, and are diagnosed and treated. This will be allied to learning and developing skills in epidemiology, how epidemics can be controlled and prevented, and the principle of risk management. This minor will be useful for future population health professionals, medical scientists, researchers, or those involved in biological risk management.
