- Previous Code: SM1145.1
- Since the revival of humanist thought in the Renaissance, universities have placed studies in history and political thought at the centre of of intellectual inquiry. History and politics have always examined contentious issues. Students learn to deal with conflicting information, appreciate the different ways societies have resolved issues in the past and develop skills that enable them to become responsible and active citizens. The History and Political Thought minor requires students to select two of four compulsory subjects which introduce the student to historical periods from the Ancient World to the 20th century, culminating in a capstone subject that discusses the development of historical methodology from ancient times to the present. The remaining two subjects can be selected from a pool that encompasses political thought and historical developments across time and space, enabling students to select fields of particular interest.
