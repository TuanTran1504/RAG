Academic Handbook Current Edition BIOS 1001 Biodiversity Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300802 Coordinator Julie Old Opens in new window Description How many species walk, fly, swim or slither, crawl, hop, wriggle or just float, hitchhike or move so slowly that they appear not to move at all? No one knows and new species appear almost every day. This subject focuses on this spectacular diversity of living things and the process of evolution. Students explore and classify biodiversity and how organisms function, acquire and assimilate resources and co-ordinate growth and reproduction. Organisms interact with one another and their environment forming a complex set of interactions in ecosystems. It is these interactions that have driven evolution. Ultimately human survival depends on the sustainable use of this biodiversity and ecosystems.

Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Describe the characteristics of major biological groups and demonstrate how this information can be used to classify an unknown organism.
Explain and provide examples that demonstrate how evolution has given rise to biodiversity.
Describe and explain the role of cells, tissues and organs in the structure and function of organisms.
Explain how organisms acquire the resources necessary to function.
Describe the scientific method and demonstrate how it can be used to test explanations of observations by formulating testable hypotheses and designing experiments.
Conduct basic investigations of organisms using microscopy, experimentation and perform data analysis and interpret results.
Apply and transfer chemical principles to other contexts such as the origin of life, and how organisms acquire the necessary resources to sustain life.
Evaluate data and evidence from scientific literature. Subject Content The characteristics of living things and the nature of Biodiversity
