- This postgraduate major is designed for science graduates interested in a career in horticulture, protected cropping, greenhouse technology, postharvest technology, and agricultural biotechnology, working in a variety of settings such as food production, research and development, technical and senior management. This unique opportunity in greenhouse horticulture offers students exciting learning opportunities to develop expertise to meet future challenges to food supply, crop management, greenhouse control systems, and integrated pest management in a world-class greenhouse facility. Students will meet with industry experts and growers in becoming professional horticultural researchers with the technical and critical thinking skills to solve complex real-world problems and articulate appropriate solutions. A capstone subject involving either a research or professional industry project allows students to integrate their knowledge and skills developed from the whole program.
