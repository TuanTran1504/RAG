Academic Handbook Current Edition PUBH 3014 Injury Prevention Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400286 Coordinator Krista Reed Opens in new window Description Injury Prevention is a National Health Priority. Injury is the preferred term rather than 'accident' with its connotations of inevitability and lack of apparent cause, to promote development of inter-disciplinary prevention initiatives.  An evidence based scientific approach to injury research and prevention is well established  for road and occupational safety, supported  by well resourced implementation structures. Other settings/sectors include sport, recreation, falls, firearms, farm, product and water safety, which are also seeing the benefits of injury prevention principles, but are less well developed. Injury prevention principles include thorough analysis of current data and the literature to identify what works to reduce injury rates, also  use of intervenation strategies termed the 4Es, (education, enforcement, engineering and environment).
