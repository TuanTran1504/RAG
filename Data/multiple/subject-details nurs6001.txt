Academic Handbook Current Edition NURS 6001 Clinical Supervision in Health Care Credit Points 10 Coordinator Sue Willis Opens in new window Description This subject provides students with the foundational knowledge and skills to enable them in their professional role to become a clinical supervisor. The practice of clinical supervision is one that is a supportive formal process enabling health care professionals to further develop and improve practice, ultimately improving outcomes for health care services and patients. Students will be able to differentiate between clinical supervision and other clinical support alternatives on the supervision continuum that are available to nurses and midwives. Students will also draw on various clinical supervision models and educational theories which underpin clinical supervision practices. Utilising principles of effective supervision (including ethical, legal and professional considerations) students will develop their own skills in self-awareness and reflective practice and be able to apply these skills to enhance the professional growth of peers, colleagues and other health care practitioners.
