- Health Promotion extends beyond raising awareness of healthcare issues to developing and implementing strategies for communities, individuals and policy makers to support good health and wellbeing. Graduates may help address health inequities in communities, link individuals and communities with healthcare, and assist individuals and communities to follow healthy behaviours, working across sectors and engaging collaboratively with communities to do so. Health promotion projects are as diverse as injury prevention, skin cancer prevention, HIV/AIDS awareness and community development. Graduates with studies in health promotion develop understandings of health that may be applied in health work settings. The program combines studies of health politics and planning, health promotion practice and public health with a comprehensive foundation in the health sciences
