This subject adopts a range of perspectives to critically evaluate developments in theory, laws, policies and practices concerned with the legal regulation of intimate relationships, particularly after separation.  Family law balances the competing rights, obligations and interests of partners, children and others following separation, often in the context of complex family dynamics.  In addition to having a sound grasp of family law, family lawyers must also appreciate the social, political, psychological and economic contexts that influence separating families.
