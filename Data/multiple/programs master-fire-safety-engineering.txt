- AQF Level:
- This program applies to students who commenced in 2022 or later.
- Students should follow the program structure for the session start date relevant to the year they commenced.
- For Commencement Year Summer A 2017/2018, please refer to: 3705.3 Master of Fire Safety Engineering
- For Commencement Year 2016 - please refer to 3705.2 Master of Fire Safety Engineering
- For Commencement Year 2015 - please refer to 3705.1 Master of Fire Safety Engineering
- The Master of Fire Safety Engineering aims to provide professionals with the special skills and knowledge to develop, assess and evaluate fire safety engineering solutions for buildings. It is relevant to professionals developing performance solutions using the fire engineering guidelines to meet the objectives and performance requirements of building regulations. Graduates will also acquire the skill to independently appraise the literature and address fire safety engineering issues faced by the building industry. This program can be completed in two years of full-time study, but the recommended study load is completion in three years in part-time mode.
- The program has been designed primarily for External delivery. Many of the units have non-compulsory workshops that can be either attended online or on campus. Students are encouraged to attend these workshops to gain the benefit of interaction with their peers. Students will need to undertake a year’s relevant work experience if not already working within the fire engineering industry.
- Early Exits
- Students may exit this program on completion of 40 credit points with a 3792 Graduate Certificate in Fire Safety Engineering or on completion of 80 credit points with a 3791 Graduate Diploma in Fire Safety Engineering
- Study Mode
- Three years part-time. Students can fast-track by completing additional subjects per semester to complete the program earlier.
