Academic Handbook Current Edition BEHV 7027 Psychological Interventions 1 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 101213 Coordinator Evelyn Smith Opens in new window Description This subject covers the theory and practice of Cognitive Behaviour (CBT) from a competency-based perspective. The competency paradigm is introduced first before key competencies including CB-Assessment, formulation, psychoeducation, behavioural (behavioural activation, exposure therapy and behavioural experiments) and cognitive intervention techniques are discussed. For each competency domain, knowledge (theory, models and principles), knowledge-application (procedural knowledge), technical skills (e.g., socratic dialogue) and relationship skills (engagement, collaboration, and collaborative empiricism) are addressed. Higher-order integrative competencies including the use of CBT in multicultural contexts, and meta-competencies such as scientist-practitioner and reflective-practitioner competencies are discussed towards the end of the subject. In alignment with competency-based pedagogies, learning activities include didactic presentations, knowledge-application tasks and skills training within small groups, and assessments include a demonstration of  competence appropriate for a developing CB practitioner.
