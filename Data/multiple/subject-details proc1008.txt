Academic Handbook Current Edition PROC 1008 Introduction to Materials Engineering Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301421 Coordinator Qinghua Zeng Opens in new window Description Modern science and technology is highly dependent on materials whose properties can be controlled to accommodate a wide range of applications. Materials are of the utmost importance for scientists and engineers who need to select appropriate materials for system design and engineering applications. Students will explore the structure and properties of all types of materials, including metals, ceramics, polymers and composites through theories, principles and a range of experiments. Participation in the lab experiments puts theoretical knowledge into practice enhancing each studentâ€™s understanding of materials properties, diffusion mechanisms, corrosion, and degradation as well as ways to achieve equilibrium. Graduates who have completed this subject may pursue careers as materials scientists, engineers, researchers, or consultants in industries such as aerospace, automotive, electronics, energy, biomedical, and manufacturing, among others.
