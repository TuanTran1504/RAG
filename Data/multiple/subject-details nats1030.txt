Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 1030 Human Anatomy and Physiology 2  (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Coordinator Anne Bertoldo Opens in new window Description Human Anatomy and Physiology 2 systematically covers anatomy and physiology at an introductory level. This subject is designed to provide students, especially those in clinical health science programs, with an overview of body systems and their functions, to ensure a suitable basis for their future studies. The subject studies the basic structure and function of the major body systems such as cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, urinary, reproductive and lymphatic. This subject also explores the physiological processes involved in the immune response, cell metabolism, regulation of body fluids and acid-base balance. Emphasis is placed on the interconnection and relationship between structure and function at every level of organisation.
