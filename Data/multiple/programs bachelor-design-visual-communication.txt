With an emphasis on studio-based practice, you will study areas such as image design, typography, layout design, branding, design history, research methods, and web-based design. From year two, there are opportunities to engage with live community or industry projects, and you will choose two practical specialisations from the following pairs: motion design and data visualisation; game and app design; illustration; and photography. You may also choose electives from outside of design such as advertising and media production. Throughout the program, you will engage with individual and team-based projects, develop your conceptual thinking skills, use a variety of traditional and emerging technologies, and expand your creative practice. In year four you will take a position in our award-winning teaching design studio where you will gain experience in a professional learning environment, preparing you for work in an exciting and evolving industry.
