Academic Handbook Current Edition MEDI 7049 Advanced MR Theory Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401324 Coordinator James Nol Opens in new window Description This subject provides students with a detailed understanding of "MR Accessories, Image Quality and Contrast Media" employed in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology and the relationship between magnet and coil, the utilisation of the different channels for image formation and pixilation, as well as exploring the role contrast media plays in enhancing body organs. Students will have an in-depth understanding of interactive effects of scanning parameters on the image quality and how to prevent the formation of artefacts and reduce Specific Absorption Rate to improve image quality, reduce artefact and reduce heat generation, and to prevent harm of burns to the patient.
