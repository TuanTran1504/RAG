Academic Handbook Current Edition AGRI 2005 Sustainable Food Production Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300791 Coordinator Richard Thomas Opens in new window Description Sustainable Food Production provides students with the knowledge and skills required to analyse current and future food production systems with an emphasis on water and energy efficiency.  The subject material integrates agronomic principles with food supply chain analysis.  This approach facilitates an analytical framework that goes beyond farm-gate productivity by including aspects of the food supply chain.  Key concepts include water use efficiency, nitrogen balance, energy balance, life cycle assessment, and greenhouse gas emissions.  Case studies will be drawn from a range of food production systems, emphasising productivity per unit of input.
