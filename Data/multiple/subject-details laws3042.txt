Academic Handbook Current Edition LAWS 3042 Jurisprudence Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200649 Coordinator Bradley Gooding Opens in new window Description This subject engages students in the critical analysis of modern law through reflection on the major traditions and contemporary practices of legal theory. The subject encourages students to examine and question key legal concepts that inform the law, such as power, morality and truth. Students will interpret, analyse, justify and critique issues and ideas using tools of critical reflection drawn from texts in legal philosophy, ancient to modern. In this way, they will develop tools that allow them to understand and uncover the foundational ideas and assumptions on which we base our view of the law and its consequences, leaving students well-placed to embark upon systematic inquiries in legal reform and further studies in legal theory.
