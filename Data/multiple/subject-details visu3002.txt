Academic Handbook Current Edition VISU 3002 Photomedia: Fashion and Identity Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 100941 Coordinator Enrico Scotece Opens in new window Description This subject explores issues of identity through photographic practice as used in Fashion Photography. Fashion is a universal form of self-expression, making it the communication strategy most employed to express identity based on material and non-material cultures. The role of photography in the creation of iconic and culturally referential images in both commercial and editorial work will be researched, analysed and interpreted in order to place the student's work in context. It provides students with capacity building through an advanced experience with studio lighting, digital effects for fashion based image making and experience with location and studio photography and of professional photography as it is used in fashion publications.
