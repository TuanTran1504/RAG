Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 4021 Studio: Interdisciplinary Global Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301294 Coordinator Sasha Alexander Opens in new window Description This subject engages students in a collaborative evidenced based project with local and international expert partners including NASA in the thematic area of Designing for Space Missions 2025 for astronaut health and space architecture for habitat design. Students are able to explore new concepts and integrate their skills within teams across unique research domains. The traditional linear thinking of creativity and innovation is challenged, giving way to a dynamic workspace for discussion, exploration, discovery, critical reflective practice, and maker-culture. This leads to new co-created interdisciplinary innovations which assist in the preparation of students for the Future of Work and decision-making across diverse teams. The focus on the physical and psychological aspects of space are also informing new viewpoints in designing with COVID19 in the Built Environment.
