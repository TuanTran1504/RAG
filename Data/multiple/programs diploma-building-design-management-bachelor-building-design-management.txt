- This program develops the skills necessary for a role in the integrated design and delivery of building projects. Students develop skills in building design along with an understanding of ‘buildability’ issues, accurate cost forecasting, risk management and sustainable project delivery. The ability to work as a part of a multi-disciplinary project team and to negotiate favourable outcomes in complex project environments is fostered through simulations of real-life building projects. Students will acquire a comprehensive overview of construction project delivery. All aspects of building design are included: commencing with an initial design concept; extending to design brief formation; project documentation; quality control management during the building process; and finally leading to project handover. Students will be required to undertake approved practical experience during the program. This experience will support and complement their formal study.
