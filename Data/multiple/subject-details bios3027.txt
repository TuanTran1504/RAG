Academic Handbook Current Edition BIOS 3027 Molecular Biology of the Cell Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301251 Coordinator Liza Cubeddu Opens in new window Description Molecular biology is central to many fields of the biomedical and natural sciences, and includes genetics, immunology, cell biology, biochemistry, and forensics. Through comparative studies of different organisms, this subject will explain fundamental concepts and methods in the study of DNA and RNA, extending to the application of molecular biology in more advanced fields such as genomics. Subjects will include DNA replication; transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of gene expression; microarrays, and an introduction to bioinformatics. Practical work will provide opportunities to become familiar with the methods of molecular biology, with an emphasis on the development of problem solving and analytical skills.Students may be required to travel to a different campus to undertake this subject.
