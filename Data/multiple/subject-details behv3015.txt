Academic Handbook Current Edition BEHV 3015 Motor Control and Skill Acquisition Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400886 Coordinator Kylie Steel Opens in new window Description Motor Control and Skill Acquisition is an investigation of the physiological and psychological processes involved in both the control and the learning of movement.  As such, it considers the control mechanisms which are innate to the learner, how these mechanisms change by virtue of both maturation and experience, and how the latter type of changes may be facilitated by manipulation of the learning environment.
