Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 3032 Machine Learning Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301435 Coordinator Yi Guo Opens in new window Description Machine Learning is one of the most important technologies in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science used to explain large datasets, inform decisions and highlight risks. Machine Learning is relevant for solving a range of problems in many industries dealing with significant amounts of information and the structure of that information. In this unit, students put Machine Learning theory into action through widely used algorithms and practical applications for designing, training, and evaluating common learning models and systems. Students use Python programming and, as a result, learn about its important machine learning libraries and packages, such as Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow for solving practical problems and tasks.
