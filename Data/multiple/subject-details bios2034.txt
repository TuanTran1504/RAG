Academic Handbook Current Edition BIOS 2034 Principles of Evolution Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300980 Coordinator Paul Rymer Opens in new window Description This subject is designed to impart an understanding of the core concepts in modern evolutionary theory, and an appreciation of the central position it plays in unifying all sub-disciplines of biology. The subject will cover modern synthesis, phylogenetics, phylogeography, origin of variation, genetic drift, natural selection, and coevolution, with a major emphasis on evolutionary mechanisms and analytical techniques.

BIOS 1012 Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Define evolution and provide supporting evidence
Explain the concepts of natural selection, biological adaptation and speciation
Assess the relative importance of neutral and selective processes in population divergence and speciation
Determine the direction and strength of migration, and the origin of genetic variation
Construct and interpret evolutionary phylogenies according to the concepts of common ancestry and parsimony of derived characters
Test the importance of interactions in driving trait shifts in a geographic context
Critically assess and interpret scientific literature, and advances in the field of research
Design, execute, analyse and interpret scientific experiments
Communicate the findings of investigations and experiments in oral and written form
Analyse the application of evolutionary theory to many modern issues, including (but not limited to) infectious disease, human behaviour, and genetic engineering Subject Content This subject provides a framework for understanding the concepts of evolutionary biology. It offers an overview of the subject by focusing on the nature of species and how they interact in ecological systems to drive evolutionary change. Students will examine evolutionary theory and supporting evidence from the fossil record, embryonic development, to DNA. Techniques in inferring phylogenetic relationships, estimating divergence times, trait evolution and origin of variation will be applied. Other subjects to be discussed include the role of biodiversity, development, evolution of sex, cooperation and behaviour, infectious disease, coevolution and human evolution.
The subject will have four major topics following the selected textbook, which will be taught over 3 weeks (delivery online modules & quizzes, 3 x 2hr lecture, 1-2 lab/workshop) with 3-4 concepts to explore where specific techniques and examples will be demonstrated/provided.
