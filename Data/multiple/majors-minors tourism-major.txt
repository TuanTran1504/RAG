- Western Sydney University Major Code:
- Previous Code: M1105.1
- The Tourism major introduces contemporary tourism issues and provides an in-depth understanding of tourism as a social phenomenon in a highly mobile world. Successful tourism planning and management relies on a full appreciation of the context in which it is operating. This suite of subjects enables a critical examination of the relationship between tourism and the assets which underpin it - the heritage of places - natural, social and cultural. It is these attributes which provide much of the incentive and attractions for travel, and which provide the business of tourism. Graduates with a tourism major can contemplate careers within a diverse range of government, non-government organization and businesses that require understanding, insight and skills related to tourism policy, planning and management.
