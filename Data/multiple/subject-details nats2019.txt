Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 2019 Forensic and Environmental Analysis Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300843 Coordinator Andrew Shalliker Opens in new window Description This subject extends the student's knowledge and experience of analytical techniques by applying them to forensic investigations and analysis in the environmental and food sciences. It will provide an understanding of the chemical and physical principles underlying the use of instrumentation in chemical analysis. Topics include principles of spectroscopic techniques, separation methods; sample collection and storage; presumptive testing; modern chemical instrumentation for gas and liquid chromatography; atomic spectroscopy; mass spectroscopy; x-ray methods and spectroscopic methods.

Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Demonstrate a familiarity with a range of instrumental analytical techniques that are relevant to forensic and environmental investigations.
Describe the underlying chemical principles of chromatography including the basic theory and practical applications.
Show an understanding of instrumental analysis, the factors which govern its application in real-world situations and the limitations and interferences of specific techniques.
Explain how presumptive tests are used in forensic and environmental analyses.
Discuss the concepts in designing experiments for analysing forensic, environmental and food samples including principles of sampling and sample preparation.
Conduct instrumental investigations to determine concentrations of specific analytes relevant to either a forensic or environmental analysis.
Perform result analysis of experimental data including error calculation by applying relevant statistics. analyse and graph data and draw appropriate conclusions from data.
Record and communicate the results of their investigations demonstrating awareness of the conventions of scientific writing and graphical presentations. Subject Content 1. Introduction to instrumental analysis - comparison with wet chemical methods
