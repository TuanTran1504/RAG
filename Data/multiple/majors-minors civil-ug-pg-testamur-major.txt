- Associate Degree in Engineering
- This Civil testamur major applies to students who commenced in the Associate Degree in Engineering in Quarter 1, 2023 or later. If you commenced prior to 2023, please refer to the KT7000 Civil major in the legacy handbook for details.
- Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)
- Qualification for this award requires the successful completion of 320 credit points, which include the subjects listed in the recommended sequence below.
- * All students undertaking the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) are required to enrol in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary and undertake a readiness test at the beginning of their study.
- MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary
- The readiness test will be conducted at the beginning of the first semester of enrolment and the result will be used to determine whether a student will remain in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary or be transferred by the School to MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1
- MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary
- MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1
- Students remaining in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary will be required to complete MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1 during second semester and will be encouraged to complete MATH 1019 Mathematics for Engineers 2 during the Summer session.
- MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary
- MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1
