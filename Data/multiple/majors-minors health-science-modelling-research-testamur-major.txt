- In this Field of Study students investigate the structure and operation of the health care system, and how data modelling can be applied to support effective decision-making. Management and change issues in health care are considered from the perspective of data generation, management, and communication to enable system operation and enhancement, such as tele-health and tele-medicine.  Applied research findings enable students to use health informatics to inform management and decision making in the health care environment.
