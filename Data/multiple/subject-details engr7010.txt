Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 7010 Fire Engineering Science Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301048 Coordinator Won Hee Kang Opens in new window Description This subject aims to enhance students' knowledge of the fundamental principles of physics, including heat and mass transfer, fluid mechanism and thermodynamics, which govern the natural phenomena associated with fires. The subject also covers properties of materials, basic mathematics and numerical methods for students to become familiar with quantitative analysis of fire dynamics and structural response. In addition, students will learn probability and risk concepts in fire safety engineering. This is a bridging subject for students who are admitted to the Graduate Certificate and Graduate Diploma in Fire Safety Engineering without an engineering or physical science background. It lays the foundation for further studies in fire safety engineering courses.
