Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 3006 Anatomy of the Head and Neck Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300897 Coordinator Manisha Dayal Opens in new window Description This subject builds on the systems anatomy taught during the first year, offering a regional study of the human head & neck. Emphasis is placed on the identification and description of the structures, including the correlation of structure and function. Cadaveric specimens are used to aid the learning of these regions and their three-dimensional aspect, including the anatomical variation found in these regions.
