- AQF Level:
- CRICOS Code: 106435C
- This program applies to students who commenced in 2022 or later.
- Handbook Summary 2022-2023
- Neuromorphic Engineering is an exciting inter-disciplinary field combining aspects from electrical engineering, computer science, neuroscience, signal processing and mathematics. The Master of Neuromorphic Engineering offers students an opportunity to partner with high-profile industry partners in an applied project or a research project, mentored by leading researchers from the International Centre for Neuromorphic Systems at the MARCS Institute. This program seeks to address the rapidly growing demand for alternative inter-disciplinary technologies, such as bio-inspired agile sensory systems, smart edge devices, and brain-inspired high performance computational platforms. The students will be introduced to state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware, sensors and algorithms in a highly structured way that increases their acumen for approaching new situations with creativity and initiative.
- All students will enrol in the 8124 Master of Neuromorphic Engineering and have the option to transition to 8123 Master of Neuromorphic Engineering (Research) at the end of their first year. A student completing the two-year degree may apply to pursue a PhD. Two exit options (Graduate Certificate in Neuromorphic Engineering and Graduate Diploma in Neuromorphic Engineering) are also available.
- The majority of the coursework subjects will be undertaken at Parramatta City - Hassall St campus, while the applied project and research project will be located at Penrith campus.
