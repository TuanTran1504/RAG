- Previous Code: M1059.1
- Language majors and minors aim to enable students to develop an appropriate level of proficiency in a second language, which may be used for professional purposes such as teaching, interpreting and translation, business or international relations. Students undertaking a language major or minor will be able to use the language in question according to its grammatical and pragmatic principles, communicate with native speakers appropriately in the spoken as well as the written mode, and demonstrate an understanding of the cultures and societies associated with the language.

- Major Structure
- There are three entry levels into language majors. Beginner’s level is for those with no previous study or minimal study of the language. Intermediate level is typically for students who: are non-native speakers with study of the language to HSC 2 Subject level or have a home background in the language but no comprehensive formal study, or who speak a non-standard variety (e.g. dialect). Post-Intermediate level is typically for students who are non-native speakers with substantial formal study and near-native competence; or are literate native speakers of a standard variety. Students should consult with the Languages staff regarding the progression sequence that best fits their level of skill. During the first two weeks of class, the lecturer will monitor the performance of students and advise students who need to transfer to a higher or lower class. Students may consult with the Languages Academic Program Advisor, if they are unsure of their entry level. Students should avoid enrolling in subjects at different levels at the one time (e.g. you should not enrol in Arabic 201 and Arabic 301 at the same time). Please check the current timetable as some subjects may not be offered every year. Advanced (Level 3) subjects may be offered on a rotational basis.
- A major in Arabic comprises a sequence of 80 credit points with 60 credit points at Level 2 and 3 (with no less than 30 credit points of these at Level 3), however students commencing at beginner’s level, that is subjects 101 and 102, and who follow the recommended program structure, are only required to complete 20 credit points at Level 3.
- Students should take subjects that reflect their level of competence in the language and they should not backtrack, i.e. they must not:
- Level 1 Subjects
- Level 2 Subjects
- Level 3 Subjects
- The subjects listed below count towards completion of the major for students who passed these subjects in 2015 or earlier.
