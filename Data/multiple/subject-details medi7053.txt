Academic Handbook Current Edition MEDI 7053 MR Body and Pelvis Imaging Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401327 Coordinator James Nol Opens in new window Description MR Body and Pelvis Imaging is a core subject in the course of Advanced Imaging (MRI). The subject provides students with in-depth knowledge of Body and Pelvis anatomy and the relevant protocols to create Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences for the anatomical regions in the Thoracic, Abdominal and Pelvic Region for different clinical examinations. It is expected that students will develop the ability to recognise normal anatomy, identify common pathologies and be able to provide diagnostic solutions and/or develop new MRI algorithms for clinical problems. They will have the ability to either produce, request or recommend the proper sequence and the best method of operating the MRI equipment for the anatomical region in question. The subject is offered to all eligible students with a varied pathway for the two weeks clinical component relevant to their undergraduate discipline. Students will have 2 weeks of clinical training in an MRI clinical site. School Medicine Discipline Radiology Student Contribution Band HECS Band 3 10cp Check your fees via the Fees page.

Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Critically examine sectional chest, abdominal and pelvic anatomy that can be produced on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) equipment
Critique chest, abdominal and pelvic scanning principles and their common applications for different clinical problems
Set up the departmental chest, abdominal and pelvis MRI protocols
Present new Body and Pelvis imaging algorithm and techniques to peers and health professionals
Critique the use of the different equipment design for body and pelvis imaging and the different MR frequencies required to achieve the best outcome for the patient
Review image interpretation cases and analyse operation and technical setup to achieve high-level diagnostic confidence during clinical placement
Reflect on clinical and operational pathways based on the MR Body and Pelvis imaging Subject Content 1.
