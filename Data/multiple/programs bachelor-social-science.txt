- The social sciences are primarily concerned with the study of social life, as it is organised and expressed within different cultures and societies.  Using key concepts, theories and knowledges from various social science disciplines students in the Bachelor of Social Science program develop a foundational understanding of human behaviour, social interactions and relationships, social systems and structures, places and cultures. This knowledge is used to identify and research complex social issues and propose evidence-based solutions to contemporary social problems.  Encouraging innovation and critical thinking, the program provides students with the skills to consciously and ethically pursue social justice and to advocate for, and respond to, social change.
- The degree caters to individual student interests, while also preparing graduates for employment in a complex, culturally diverse and ever-changing social environment.  It includes optional placement subjects and provides opportunities to develop valuable work-place skills in research and communication, analysis, data and digital literacy, and community engagement.
