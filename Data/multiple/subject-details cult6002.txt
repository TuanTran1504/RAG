Academic Handbook Current Edition CULT 6002 Gender Security and Violence Credit Points 10 Coordinator Selda Dagistanli Opens in new window Description Deploying critical feminist and gender theory, this subject examines and distinguishes between specific issues pertaining to gender violence within war and peace, and across different domestic and international contexts. Through the lens of actual, threatened, and symbolic gender violence and its consequences, this subject also unpacks the concept of gender (in)security as a distinct component within human security more broadly. Throughout the semester, students will consider these themes through analysis of domestic and international case studies and will be required to discern effective practices and responses to gender violence from approaches that perpetuate gender inequity and harm. By the end of this subject, students will be able to draft theoretically informed gender security initiatives.
