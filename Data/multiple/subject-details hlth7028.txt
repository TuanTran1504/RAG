Health professionals are recurrently asked to engage in reflective practice as a way to improve clinical and non-clinical reasoning. The ability to reflect on action and in action allows health professionals not only to improve their practice but also to more clearly articulate their strengths and weaknesses to potential employers. In this subject, students will focus on creating an portfolio that will require revisiting all content learned throughout their courses to critically assess their learning journey and learning outcomes. It will teach students how to systematically self-reflect in deep and transformative ways, engaging with theory and knowledge acquired and developed through their studies to design and create a portfolio of their skills and competencies through a social capital framework.
