- Western Sydney University Minor Code:
- Every day, our lives are impacted by machines processing data about us, often with the goal of predicting future outcomes or depicting trends. Yet this processing typically happens in a black box that we can’t often see. We are invited to trust the outcomes, but there are real questions about privacy, liability, fairness, and transparency. This Minor in Humanising Data will help students explore what’s behind data analysis, paving the way for increasing our knowledge and understanding of data and opening up employment opportunities in applied areas of data analytics such as data privacy engineers or marketing specialists.
- This minor is a Challenge Minor, which is an innovative transdisciplinary minor co-created with students as partners. With a Challenge Minor, your learning reaches beyond your discipline, giving you the chance to amplify your learning in new directions. For more information, visit the Challenge Minor website.
