The Master of Creative Music Therapy program at Western takes an intentionally creative approach to training students to be career-ready music therapists. The Australian Music Therapy Association (AMTA) competencies are taught and learning across a range of music therapy approaches is included. Students develop the knowledge and ability to creatively apply their existing music skills therapeutically for individuals and groups, through improvisational (creating improvised music), re-creative (creatively using repertoire/songs), compositional (creating songs/music) and receptive (creative listening) methods. Applicants who meet the admission criteria who are from diverse backgrounds and experiences are warmly encouraged to apply. Graduates of this program are eligible to apply to register with the AMTA, which qualifies them to practice professionally in Australia as a Registered Music Therapist (RMT).
