- Students enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts (Pathway to Teaching Birth-5/Birth-12) will complete two subjects in Year 3 from the Mathematics teaching subjects sets in order to complete a minor in Mathematics and meet the BA component of a NESA teaching specialisation in Mathematics. Students enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts (Pathway to Teaching Early Childhood/Primary) may use their flexible subjects to study four specialised subjects in Mathematics. These 4 subjects together with completion of subjects in the Master of Teaching (Birth-5 Years/Birth-12 Years), enable students to graduate from the Master of Teaching (Birth-5 Years/Birth-12 Years) with a NESA Primary Teaching Specialisation in Mathematics.
