Academic Handbook Current Edition INFO 3020 Cyber Security and Behaviour Research Project Credit Points 40 Coordinator Alana Maurushat Opens in new window Description This is a 40 credit point year-long subject taken over two terms (20 credit points in each term). This subject comprises the research pathway of the Bachelor of Cyber Security and Behaviour. Students will undertake a major research project in the field of behavioural cyber security. The specifics of the project will be coordinated between the student and the research supervisor at Western, which is undertaken over two semesters. Students should firstly discuss their proposed research project with the research supervisor, as it may require prior approval by the University's Ethics Committee depending on the research topic chosen. In the first semester, students plan their research, complete a literature review and propose the project plan to a panel of experts. By the end of the second semester students will have completed their thesis by research and will defend that thesis to a panel of experts. As such, students will have contributed to research in the field of cyber security and behaviour which prepares them for further studies towards a Masters or PhD qualification.
