- Professional Practice Experience
- The Bachelor of Nursing - WSU Online will conduct compulsory on-campus residential intensives for each Professional Practice Experience subject.
- The Professional Practice Experience is the foundation for student learning in the course. It consists of two major learning contexts for students: professional practice and simulation. Professional practice in the health care sector may take place in any level of the health service appropriate to the focus for the specific Professional Practice Experience unit, for example aged care facilities, hospitals, General Practitioner practices, community health teams. This environment is essential for providing students complexity of the nursing experience, the ability to apply learning in situations involving ill persons, and socialises students into the work domain.
- Simulation is a teaching and learning strategy where aspects of the professional practice environment, such as a hospital ward or patient, are artificially created on campus to enable students to learn in a safe, non-threatening environment. Clinical Practice Subjects, simulated professional practice environments, will be used to allow students to undertake learning activities related to all core nursing skills such as administering medications and monitoring a patientâ€™s condition. The School has a wide range of simulation equipment and dedicated high fidelity simulation rooms on each campus.
- The percentage of time spent by students in each context will vary depending on the stage of the student in the program, the theoretical knowledge already acquired and the stage of competency development. For example at the beginning of the program more hours will be spent in the simulation context than in the health care sector. As the program progresses there is a scaling up of hours spent in the health care sector with fewer hours being spent in the simulation context. In the final session of third year a significant proportion of knowledge and skills consolidation will occur primarily in a clinical practice environment.
