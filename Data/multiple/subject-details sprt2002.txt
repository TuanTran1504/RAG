Academic Handbook Current Edition SPRT 2002 Exercise Testing and Measurement Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401150 Coordinator Dean Norris Opens in new window Description This subject provides students with an understanding of the safety, ethical, logistical and theoretical considerations for administering tests and conducting measurements within the Exercise Science scope of practice. Students will develop skills in data analysis, data visualisation and generating reports to hypothetical clients within the Sport & Exercise sector. The subject introduces numerous physical and physiological tests, together with performance analysis and monitoring techniques, with a particular focus on the measurement accuracy of data collected. Students will evaluate and interpret data from tests to inform further practice in exercise prescription and exercise recommendations.
