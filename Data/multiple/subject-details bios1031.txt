The subject uses current resource issues and scientific concepts to provide the practical and theoretical information needed for students to think critically about environmental issues and to contribute to the sustainable management of natural and built environments. Students will also learn how science and society interact in the management of resources. Using the concept of ecologically sustainable development as a foundation, students will use critical thinking skills to research a resource issue of their choice at the local, national and/or international level.  Students will communicate their research using new mediaexploring the issue and make recommendations for improving sustainability.
