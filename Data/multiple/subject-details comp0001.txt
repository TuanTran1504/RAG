Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 0001 Introductory Programming (WSTC Prep) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700204 Coordinator Zdenka Misanovic Opens in new window Description The subject introduces students to computer programming as an essential tool for problem-solving and data analysis in engineering and science. The focus is on using an algorithmic approach to problem solving. Students will learn how to analyse and solve problems by designing an algorithm and implementing it in a high-level programming language. This subject includes extensive practical work and problem-solving activities. It prepares students for the first year subject, Engineering Computing, in the Bachelor programs in Engineering. Students will also be able to use their acquired programming skills to perform calculations, analyse data and create graphs for their projects and reports in other subjects.
