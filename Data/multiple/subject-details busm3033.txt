Academic Handbook Current Edition BUSM 3033 International Management Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200623 Coordinator Louise Kippist Opens in new window Description International Management provides an overview of issues confronting managers working in a complex globalised environment.  Areas such as global and regional integration, the role of ethics and social responsibility, as well as the changing political, legal and technological environment require consideration by management in multinational organisations. The role of culture and human resource management is another significant area of failure by global managers. Finally global strategic issues such as managing political risk and government relations will be analysed to allow a deeper level of understanding of the complexities of managing in an internationally competitive marketplace.
