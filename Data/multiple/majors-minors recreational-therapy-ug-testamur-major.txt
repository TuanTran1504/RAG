- Recreational Therapy links leisure and health improvement. Recreational Therapy graduates work with patients to use leisure activities to improve health and life quality, for example in rehabilitation centres, psychiatric units, special schools, day care centres, aged care facilities, and in a range of local government or community services settings. The major combines theory and practice in learning, education programming, aged care, disability and mental health, with a comprehensive foundation of the health sciences. Students will develop the professional competencies important for ethical and safe practice and high-quality care, and the skills to work in multidisciplinary teams. Evidence-based practice is one of the most important trends in healthcare today and is a strong feature of the major. The recreational therapy program is offered on campus or fully online. Students may combine this testamur major in recreational therapy with a minor in health promotion, therapeutic modalities, psychology or exercise and physical activity, or the option to choose up to 40cp of electives based on the studentâ€™s interest. This flexibility will help diversify the knowledge-base and skillset of students. The course includes 160 hours of compulsory practical placement in second year and a third-year internship of 560 hours - meeting the practice placement requirement for eligibility as a Certified Recreation Therapist with the National Council of Therapeutic Recreation Certification (NCTRC).
