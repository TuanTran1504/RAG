Academic Handbook Current Edition HLTH 2025 Exercise Nutrition Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 401436 Coordinator Ben Dascombe Opens in new window Description This subject provides students with an understanding of the interdependent areas of nutrition within the context of sport, physical activity, and exercise. Nutritional needs and recommendations for all levels and types of physical activity are covered along with the links between nutrition and health, sport performance, body composition and control of body weight. Students will develop skills in nutritional analysis and program development, measurement of energy expenditure and body composition assessment. Students will use these skills and knowledge in the individualisation of advice on exercise nutrition for health and sport performance.
