This will be addressed at the levels of organ systems, tissues, cells and molecules. The scientific basis of the following topics will be discussed: whole body organisation including basic anatomy, roles of the major organ systems, functional organisation of cells and their specific organelles, characteristics of specialised cells, structure-function characteristics of major biological molecules including carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, enzymes and DNA, the biochemical basis of complex processes such as homeostasis, reproduction and inheritance, growth and development, defence against infectious agents, pathological changes, ageing and death.
2. The unit then examines nutrition and metabolism before exploring the structure, function and pathology of the gastrointestinal system (including liver), cardiovascular system and respiratory system.
3. In the Personal and Professional Development (PPD) stream there is a focus on developmental psychology, the patient experience, the doctor, human interactions, the human in context and the healthcare system.
4. Population health will focus on Evidence Based Medicine in sessions 1 and 2.
