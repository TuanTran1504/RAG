Academic Handbook Current Edition COMM 2009 Cinema and Censorship Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102192 Coordinator Alex Ling Opens in new window Description Censorship of the arts has long been a contentious issue. This subject examines the cultural contexts and debates surrounding censorship, as well as the institutions, policies, and people that figure prominently in the history of cinema censorship. Censorship discourses reveal shifts in how 'national morality' is constructed, and often display cultural anxieties about changing meanings of gender, sexuality, race, and class. This subject offers an historical survey of film censorship from the 1890s to today, utilising various theoretical approaches (feminist theory, critical race theory, queer theory, and cultural theory), with an emphasis on topics such as obscenity, pornography, violence, and blasphemy.
