In considering multi-track diplomacy in the context of contemporary bilateral, regional, and multilateral relations, you will have the opportunity to engage with senior diplomats from Australia and elsewhere. Students will participate in a simulated soft power diplomacy campaign built upon the rich cultural diversity and international connections unique to Western Sydney, equipping you with real-world skills to effectively represent your country or organisation at an international level.
