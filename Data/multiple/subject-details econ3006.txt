Topics will include the properties of estimators, hypothesis testing, specification error, multicollinearity, dummy variables, heteroskedasticity, serial correlation. It also introduces other modelling techniques in finance and economics. Empirical assignments undertaken by the student form an integral part of the unit. The emphasis is on learning by doing in small group workshops. School Business Discipline Econometrics Student Contribution Band HECS Band 4 10cp Check your fees via the Fees page.
