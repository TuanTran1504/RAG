Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 2002 Advanced Science Project B Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300938 Coordinator Sabine Piller Opens in new window Description This subject continues the studentsâ€™ training in thinking as a research scientist whilst developing analytical and critiquing skills in a range of science disciplines. In this subject, students gain theoretical knowledge of common methods and techniques and choose to gain hands-on experience in interdisciplinary laboratory sessions, focusing on current techniques and methods in a range of science disciplines including but not limited to cell and molecular biology, chemistry, physics, biomedical science, microbiology, anatomy and physiology, and nutrition. Students will develop a strong foundation in understanding the relationship between practical techniques and data quality and reliability, which is crucial for validating research outcomes. Training in laboratory notebook best practices will be provided, emphasising the importance of accurate record-keeping in both academic and industrial research settings. Students will prepare summaries of research findings, project proposals, and progress reports from their chosen laboratory sessions using discipline-specific formats and notation. By engaging in discussions, feedback, and data analysis, students will enhance their scientific communication, presentation, and collaborative decision-making skills.
