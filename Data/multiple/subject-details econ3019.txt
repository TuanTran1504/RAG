Academic Handbook Current Edition ECON 3019 Political Economy Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200065 Coordinator Heath Spong Opens in new window Description This subject examines various political economy approaches to the analysis of economics, mainly associated with Marxian, post-Keynesian, evolutionary schools of thought as well as development economics and the perspectives of international political economy. These may be regarded as the main alternatives to neo-classical economic theory. As they do not represent a unified body of thought, the subject will survey the main contributions of each, focusing on both the positive aspects of theory and the negative aspects relating to the critique of neo-classical theory.
