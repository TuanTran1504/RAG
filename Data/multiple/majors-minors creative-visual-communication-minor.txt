- Western Sydney University Minor Code:
- We live in a culture where processing and retaining information is much more effective, engaging, and powerful when it happens through visual communication and storytelling. From design thinking and visual research to video content creation, this minor is an opportunity to experiment with a variety of creative tools and techniques so you can effectively interpret, evaluate, use, and create visual media for different purposes. With “creativity” being one of the most in-demand soft skills that employers look for, this minor will give you an edge in whatever work you do, now and in the future.
- This minor is a Challenge Minor, which is an innovative transdisciplinary minor co-created with students as partners. With a Challenge Minor, your learning reaches beyond your discipline, giving you the chance to amplify your learning in new directions. For more information, visit the Challenge Minor website.
