Academic Handbook Current Edition CIVL 3021 Bridge Engineering Design Credit Points 10 Coordinator Olivia Mirza Opens in new window Description This subject focuses on one key aspect of bridge engineering design, namely, the bridge superstructure design. It aims to provide students with specialised knowledge in bridge loading, the types of possible loads, calculation of ultimate load combinations and investigate the different sizes for the beams (girders) of simple bridge design and structural design. These aspects will be discussed in relation to Australian design codes to prepare students for roles such as design engineer or analyst. Furthermore, this subject will involve industry guest speakers, with state of the art engineering design, who will be able to review and contribute to the assessment tasks.
