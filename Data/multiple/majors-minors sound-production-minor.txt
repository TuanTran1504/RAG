- The Sound Production minor equips students with fundamental skills and knowledge of current practice in music production, sound design, new electronic media, interactive electronic media, and their applications to music performance and composition. Two foundation level subjects present an overview of the basic concepts and practical applications of electronic and digital music technology to music production and sound design in current music and media arts practice. The minor's final two subjects build on this foundational knowledge, offering progressively more challenging instruction in music technology and its applied contexts. In these subjects, students will undertake self-directed technology-based projects as sound designers, composers and performers.
