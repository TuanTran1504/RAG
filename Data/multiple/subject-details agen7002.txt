Academic Handbook Current Edition AGEN 7002 Ecosystems in a Changing World Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 800170 Coordinator Yolima Carrillo Espanol Opens in new window Description Natural and managed ecosystems on our planet are experiencing a rapidly changing environment as a consequence of changing patterns of land and resource use, loss of biodiversity, altered atmospheric composition and anthropogenic climate change. This subject will introduce students to ecosystem concepts in the context of ecological and evolutionary responses to global change. Students will obtain practical experience in quantitative analysis of carbon, nutrient, water and energy budgets, and explore the consequences of global change for ecosystem services and biodiversity over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Teaching will be led by HIE staff with expertise in ecosystem responses to environmental change, soil microbial contributions to ecosystem function and the impacts of environmental change on plants, animals and their interactions.
