- Western Sydney University Major Code:
- Previous Codes:  KT3127.1, KT3158.1, KT3163.1, KT7003.1
- This major provides the skills necessary for the design of smart machines of all types: cruise control in automobiles, pilotless spacecraft, automated factories and medical telerobotics. The major, accompanied by an extensive and integrated hands-on laboratory program, is essentially concerned with the design of intelligent mechanical systems and automation, and includes the study of robotics, computer control, automated manufacturing, microprocessor applications and machine design. Graduates in the major acquire the combined skills of mechanical and computer/electrical engineering that are needed in leading-edge industries such as aerospace systems, the car industry, automation and robotic applications, biomedical engineering, laser systems, and building materials manufacture.

- Students must complete three units as follows
- Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)
- Qualification for this award requires the successful completion of 320 credit points, which include the subjectsj listed in the recommended sequence below.
- * All students undertaking the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) are required to enrol in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary and undertake a readiness test at the beginning of their study.
- MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary
- The readiness test will be conducted at the beginning of the first semester of enrolment and the result will be used to determine whether a student will remain in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary or be transferred by the School to MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1
- MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary
- MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1
- Students remaining in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary will be required to complete MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1 during second semester and will be encouraged to complete MATH 1019 Mathematics for Engineers 2 during the Summer session.
- MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary
- MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1
- MATH 1019 Mathematics for Engineers 2
