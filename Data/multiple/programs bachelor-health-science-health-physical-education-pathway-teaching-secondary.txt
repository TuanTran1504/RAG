- The Bachelor of Health and Physical Education (HPE) Pathway to Teaching (Secondary) brings together a comprehensive foundation of health sciences, understanding of physical activity, and skills in interacting with people. The program explores challenging areas of personal development, including youth health issues, sexuality, drugs, psychology and risk-taking behaviours, as well as general health science, including human biology, health systems, health promotion and research. Enrolment in this program involves direct pathway to a Master of Teaching degree, and then on to a teaching career. Teaching opportunities can be extended beyond HPE by studying electives, such as science and mathematics, where students gain a second teaching area in a subject of their choice. The degree also gives the advantage of early access to Education Studies subjects through mandatory completion of an Education Studies minor. These subjects of study are structured to gain the necessary learning areas to satisfy the Board of Studies, Teaching and Educational Standards discipline knowledge requirements for entry into teaching.
