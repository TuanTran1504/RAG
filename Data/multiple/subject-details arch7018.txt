As such students will require to critically examine a broad range of real life professional, legal, business and ethical challenges that are likely to face in practice and apply critical thinking in order to resolve these problems. The intention here is to assist students in navigating through complex real life challenges and to bring a common sense and real world approach to solving a problem. Transitioning from university to the workplace can be quite daunting thus, the aim here is to allow students to gain the knowledge and skills to make informed decisions but most importantly to build confidence in themselves as they move forward with their career.
