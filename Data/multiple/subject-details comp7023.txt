Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 7023 Predictive Analytics Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301495 Coordinator Rosalind Wang Opens in new window Description The information age has allowed business and science to take advantage of the vast amount of available data for predicting outcomes and estimating trends, to make informed decisions. Machine learning is the process of allowing a computer to learn from data, which at its heart is used in making these important decisions. This subject provides students with the knowledge and practice required to implement and effectively use these predictive models such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines, and provides opportunity for students to investigate state-of-the-art. Students will use the Python programming language throughout this subject.
