Academic Handbook Current Edition WELF 4008 Professional Decision Making in Social Work Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102352 Coordinator Sera Harris Opens in new window Description This subject uses a problem-based learning approach to develop students' critical and practical reasoning abilities in professional decision making. Students will compare several models of decision making used at the interface of organisational and individual/family work contexts, and evaluate the usefulness of evidence based inquiry as a decision aid. Through case studies, students will discern the unique characteristics of a situation requiring professional judgement, explore their own habits or preferences in decision making, and develop reasoning skills that produce sound and ethical responses to the situation at hand.
