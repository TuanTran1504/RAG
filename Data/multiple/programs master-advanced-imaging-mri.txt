- Program Status:
- This program applies to students who commenced in 2020 or later.
- The Master of Advanced Imaging MRI, is available for students who would like to further their knowledge and skills in clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This program is offered part-time and is structured to cater for eligible Graduate Medical Practitioners, Medical Radiation Practitioners (MRP) and Allied Health and other Health Professionals including Dentists and Veterinary practitioners. The Master program provides in depth learning in MRI including basic physics as well as advanced clinical imaging techniques. Students will learn the skills to conduct an independent research project in MRI to address theoretical and/or practical issues and problems in relation to Advanced Imaging / MRI.
- There will be face-to-face or video-conferencing intensive workshops and interactions with specialists from different medical disciplines.
- The program provides two weeks clinical training in a  WSU endorsed MRI clinical site for each of the clinical units offered (ie: a total of ten weeks).
- The program offers students the option to conduct either pure medical MRI research to be eligible for registration as Medical Diagnostic Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scientists with the Australian Magnetic Resonance Imaging Association, or a workplace-based MRI research focus during their final year while attending 14-week clinical placement, required to be eligible for registration as Medical MRI Practitioners with the Australian Magnetic Resonance Imaging Association.
- Early Exits
- Students may exit this program on completion of 40 credit points with a 4769 Graduate Certificate in Advanced Imaging (MRI) or on completion of 80 credit points with a 4768 Graduate Diploma in Advanced Imaging (MRI) (exit only)

- Inherent Requirements
- Work Integrated Learning
- There is a mandatory work component required for completion of this program.  Please contact the Program Advisor listed above for information.
- International students should also refer to the link below for more information and a link to the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS).
- Work Integrated Learning (WIL) for international students
- Clinical practice is essential to complement program objectives. It is expected that students will use workplace hours to meet the clinical practice requirements. However, if students do not currently work in the field, or are unable to organise their own clinical placement at an authorised accredited site, an optional work-based practical training unit located at Blacktown-Mount Druitt Hospital or other approved location has been developed.
- Supervision requirements are by placement agreement, covering contact and learning requirements, including assessment. The Teaching team will check in with students during the course of their practicum.
- Admission
- Applicants must be a Registered medical practitioner, registered dentist, (with AHPRA) or Vet registered with the Veterinary Practitioners Registration Board of NSW or equivalent;
- or Registered Medical Radiation Practitioner (with AHPRA):
- or must have completed an Undergraduate degree in medical science, engineering, or other health practitioner degrees.
- This program requires students to have a strong academic background in maths and physics. Applicants may be requested to demonstrate their competency if this is not evident within their undergraduate studies.
- Candidates may exit the program at the Graduate certificate level (40 Credit Points)
- Candidates may exit the program at the Graduate Diploma level (80 Credit Points).
- Applicants who have undertaken studies overseas may have to provide proof of proficiency in English. Local and International applicants who are applying through the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC) will find details of minimum English proficiency requirements and acceptable proof on the UAC website. Local applicants applying directly to the University should also use the information provided on the UAC website.
