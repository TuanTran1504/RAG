Academic Handbook Current Edition CIVL 4011 Waste Management Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300994 Coordinator Dharma Hagare Opens in new window Description Sustainable waste management, to reduce climate impact, is an important consideration for any student who is getting trained as an engineer. In this subject students will identify and characterise sources of atmospheric, solid and hazardous waste generated from the community. Students will then focus on sustainable management of waste incorporating minimisation, recycle, recovery and disposable options as well as greenhouse gases and their impact on climate change.
