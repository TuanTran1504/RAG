Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 3037 Engaging in the Profession Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102755 Coordinator Paul Rooney Opens in new window Description The subject is only offered to students enrolled in the Bachelor of Education (Primary) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education program. Students need to have a variety of experiences that are set in the context of their future profession. Through these experiences they need to draw together, as a capstone, all the previous subjects in the course, integrating them through a well-balanced program that allows the students to refine their skills as beginning teachers. This gives them opportunity to reflect on the processes involved, identify their competencies and assist the school by recognising potential issues and assisting in implementation of the resulting praxis. This subject includes all areas of foundations and curriculum complementing a final practicum experience that will show the interrelationship between theory and practice. It also addresses issues that assist in the development of the individual student toward their transition into teaching. Students will produce a professional learning portfolio in this subject to demonstrate achievement of the Graduate Teacher Standards. The learning portfolio will enable students to reflect deeply on their emerging skills and understanding, towards development of a critical perspective of their practice as a teacher.
