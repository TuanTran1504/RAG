- Handbook Summary 2022-2023
- Podiatrists are best known for treating problems that people experience with their feet and lower limbs, but they are increasingly playing an important role in addressing chronic conditions such as diabetes and rheumatology. Podiatrists treat a range of patients including children, adults, workers, sportspeople and the older population. There is a focus on podiatric applications including management of common problems such as ingrown toenails or bunions, chronic disease management, musculoskeletal rehabilitation, footwear assessment and orthoses fabrication. Over the program of the program students will complete 1000 hours clinical hours inclusive of Uniclinic sessions and 19 weeks of clinical placement in a range of facilities including hospitals, community centres, private practices, and sports medicine centres, in rural and metropolitan locations. Continuing education on completion of the program can lead to opportunities for advanced practice such as restricted therapeutic prescription rights and application for training as a podiatric surgeon. The program in podiatry is offered as a 4-year Bachelor of Podiatric Medicine. The first three years of the program combine studies in podiatry with a broad understanding of biomedicine and various health science fields to develop the professional competencies important for ethical and safe practice and high quality care and the skills to work in multidisciplinary teams. The final year focuses predominately on podiatry practice skills, practical experience and specialised areas. Evidence-based practice is one of the most important trends in healthcare today and a strong feature of the program.
