- Summary 2022-2023
- Robotics and Mechatronic engineering combines electrical, computing and mechanical engineering and is at the forefront in designing smart machines and systems, such as pilotless spacecraft, car cruise control, automated factories and medical telerobotics. Students explore intelligent mechanical systems and automation through an extensive and integrated hands-on laboratory program, as well as work-integrated industry projects. Students learn in-depth knowledge about the design and construction of these systems to integrate, evaluate and address their performance. The multidisciplinary skills students develop are sought after by leading edge industries, including aerospace and biomedical engineering. This major includes a mandatory 12 weeks of industrial placement as a completion requirement.

Note: All students are required to enrol in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary first and undertake a readiness test at the beginning of their study.

This test will be conducted at the beginning of the first semester of enrolment and the result will determine whether a student will remain in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary or be transferred by the School to MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1.

The students who finish MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary will then use this unit as an elective.

Note: All students are required to enrol in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary first and undertake a readiness test at the beginning of their study.

This test will be conducted at the beginning of the first semester of enrolment and the result will determine whether a student will remain in MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary or be transferred by the School to MATH 1016 Mathematics for Engineers 1.

The students who finish MATH 1021 Mathematics for Engineers Preliminary will then use this unit as an elective.
