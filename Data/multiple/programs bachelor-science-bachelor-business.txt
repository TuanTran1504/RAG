- This program applies to students who commenced in 2022 or later.
- Students should follow the program structure for the session start date relevant to the year they commenced.
- For commencement year 2020, please refer to: 4748.3 Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Business
- For commencement year 2018, please refer to: 4748.2 Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Business
- For commencement year 2016, please refer to: 4748.1 Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Business
- The Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Business double degree program allows graduates to span both the commercial and scientific worlds in a way that single degree graduates cannot. This double degree permits students to undertake multi-skilling, and offers diverse career paths providing high marketability in multiple areas of expertise. Graduates will have a solid grounding in a core science discipline from a range of majors including Biology, Data Science, Ecology, Zoology, Environmental Health, Mathematics, and Forensic Chemistry. This qualification in science is combined with one of the following majors from the Bachelor of Business: Applied Finance, Economics, Hospitality Management, Human Resource Management, International Business, Management, Marketing, and Sport Management. Graduates will be equipped to work as scientists with a good understanding of business principles and practices. Alternatively, as Business graduates, they will be well-prepared to work in science-based industries and institutions.

- Work Integrated Learning
- There is a mandatory work component required for completion of this program.  Please contact the Program Advisor listed above for information.
- International students should also refer to the link below for more information and a link to the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS).
- Work Integrated Learning (WIL) for international students
- For the Science degree, work integrated learning is a component of many units in the core of the course and testamur majors. Students must study to a specific work integrated learning unit, Complex Case Studies in Science. This unit is designed to provide students with opportunities for personal development, industry and civic engagement and to develop career readiness. The unit assures that students can critically analyse and logically argue complex scientific issues whilst taking into account multiple competing perspectives and builds on employability and communication skills developed in earlier units.
- Admission
- Eligibility for admission to the Bachelor Science/Bachelor of Business is based on the following requirements
- http://www.uac.edu.au/ https://westernsydney.uac.edu.au/ws/

- Program Structure Current
- Qualification for this award requires the successful completion of 320 credit points as prescribed in the structure below.
- Students who complete this award will graduate with a Bachelor of Science with the selected testamur major, and a Bachelor of Business.
- Students should note that core subjects will be allocated based on the Testamur Major chosen and as indicated in the relevant testamur major sequence.
- Science Component
- Students should note that core subjects will be allocated based on the Testamur Major chosen and as indicated in the relevant testamur major sequence.
- Bachelor of Science Testamur Majors
- Students must choose one of the following testamur majors:
- Please note that not all Testamur Majors are available at all campuses.
- Business Component
- Core Subjects (compulsory 40 credit points)
- The four compulsory core subjects that provide students with essential business knowledge are:
- Professional Subjects (choose 40 credit points)
- The professional subjects provide a focus on careers. Students are required to complete one subject from each of the four key focus areas: numeracy, career planning, innovation, and enterprise engagement, a total of 40 credit points. Students are advised to choose subjects that will support careers in one of three areas:
- The professional subjects that are recommended for each of the Bachelor of Business testamur majors are specified in the majors.
- Majors (choose 80 credit points from one primary Business major. These are testamur majors)
- Students are required to complete eight major core subjects from one of the following primary Business majors.
- Majors for Careers in Money
- Majors for Careers in Markets
- Majors for Careers in Management
- Majors for Careers in Business Analytics
- Recommended Sequence Current
- Use the links to each Bachelor of Business Major to see the Core, Professional and Major subjects required. Students should follow the recommended sequence below and not the recommended sequence listed under each Bachelor of Business Major.
- This progression pattern is highly recommended. Students’ progress through both degrees at the same pace, completing two subjects in each degree in each semester. Graduation after three years with either degree will be possible only if a student makes this decision at or before the end of Year 2 and amends their progression pattern as prescribed by an Academic Program Advisor.
- Students choosing the Applied Physics testamur major should consult the Academic Program Advisor for advice regarding unit sequences.
