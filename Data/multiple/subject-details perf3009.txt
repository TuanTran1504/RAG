Students will learn to critique various methods, considering their strengths, weaknesses and appropriateness to a self-devised research project. Delivered in a workshop format, each week students will consider a method or aspect thereof and develop skills in pursuing these towards their research outcome. Methods canvassed in the subject include practice-led research, where creative practice can be both the starting point and the research outcome; primary research (where the researcher gathers information from interviews, surveys and so on), music science (cognition and computation); ethics in research; identifying appropriate fields of research; and quantitative and qualitative methods.
