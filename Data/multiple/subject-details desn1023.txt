Academic Handbook Current Edition DESN 1023 Visual Media Design (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Coordinator Ben Fletcher Opens in new window Description Professional and emerging visual communicators all share a goal: to create unique imagery that conveys a narrative to meet a design brief. This subject introduces you to photographic image making and applications of photomedia in visual communication design contexts. You will learn practical and theoretical skills that provide you with an understanding of composition, exposure, light, interpreting and responding to a design brief, and constructing a visual narrative.
 
This subject offers a context for you to understand photography by examining the contributions to established historical and contemporary visual communicators. As you advance through the subject, you will investigate and reflect on the components of image design, explore imaginative methods for creating photomedia, and develop your ability to critically assess traditional visual forms of communication.
 
By the end of this subject, you will have developed the skills and ability to create a narrative and visualise the world through images.
