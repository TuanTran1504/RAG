REHA 2003 Restrictions The Podiatric Practice subjects have been designed to be an integrated suite of subjects where one subject builds on the clinical competencies of the others. Students participate in patient assessment, diagnosis and management. It is essential that students have been able to demonstrate baseline competencies in theoretical content, patient management, infection control and safe work practices (i.e completed the preceding prerequisite subjects including Podiatry PreClinical). The subject is Podiatry specific and restricted only to students enrolled in 4708 Bachelor of Podiatric Medicine and 4709 Bachelor of Podiatric Medicine (Honours). Students must meet all inherent requirements for the podiatry program. Assumed Knowledge Completion of all core subjects to this semester/ year of study. Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: 1. Demonstrate and apply principles of professional behaviour in the clinical environment.
2. Demonstrate and apply competencies in infection control procedures for use in a patient consultation.
3. Develop and apply clinical skills in taking, presenting and documenting a patient history using UniClinic assessment forms and SOAPE format in the clinical environment.
4. Develop and clinically apply competencies in undertaking cursory vascular, neurological, dermatological and biomechanical assessment techniques for use in the patient consultation in the clinical environment.
5. Develop and demonstrate skills in clinical reasoning, using consolidation of podiatric theory, for use in goal orientated management plans in the patient consultation.
6. Develop and demonstrate basic clinical competencies in nail cutting, scalpel technique, application of dressings using aseptic technique and undertaking sterilisation procedures.
7. Develop competencies in documenting patient consultations and corresponding with other health professionals using SOAPE format, UniClinic assessment forms, patient’s records and referral letters in the clinical environment.
8. Demonstrate ability to self-evaluate and appreciate limits of own competence, including willingness to consult with peers and staff.
9. Develop and clinically apply skills in manual fabrication of basic mechanical therapy techniques including taping techniques, chair-side devices and non-cast orthoses.
10. Demonstrate and distinguish work health and safety (WH&S) competencies in the clinical environment and whilst using machinery in the orthotic therapy laboratories.
