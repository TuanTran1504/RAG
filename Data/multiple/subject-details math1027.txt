Academic Handbook Current Edition MATH 1027 Quantitative Thinking (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700123 Coordinator Rubie Herrera Opens in new window Description This Level 1 subject develops the quantitative skills that underpin many fields of study in the sciences.  The content covered includes basic algebra, functions, graphs, equations - linear and quadratic, introductory probability and descriptive statistics.  These mathematical/statistical concepts will be revised and developed using scientific concepts such as molarity and dilution, optical density, population growth, and predator-prey models.  In all aspects of this subject, students will be developing and using critical thinking skills to solve mathematical/statistical problems set in a scientific context.
