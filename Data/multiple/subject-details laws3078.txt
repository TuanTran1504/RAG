Students will participate in an exchange experience and will be intensively taught at selected Taiwanese university partners. Through engagement with Taiwanese academics, legal professionals (both in Australia at pre-departure programs and in Taiwan through engagements with leading Taiwanese law firms, courts and economic organisations), students will develop commercially relevant knowledge and contemporary practical legal skills to develop as global citizens. Students will examine diverse content areas including Taiwan's Constitutional Court, leading human rights cases, intellectual property protections, the Taiwanese electoral system, and Taiwan's innovative approaches to corporate social responsibility, big data analytics, and new technologies.   Where travel to Taiwan is not possible, the subject will be offered online with the program of study to be offered 3-hours a week over a semester and supported online by university and industry partners in Taiwan. Where travel is possible, this online program will be supplemented by a week-long excursion to Taiwan.
