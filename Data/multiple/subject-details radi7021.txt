They will learn to identify crucial features of fetal and maternal anatomy and physiology required to perform a comprehensive O&G sonographic assessment. Additionally, students will explore effective communication techniques for delivering adverse findings, managing workplace relationships, and meeting patient expectations. They will collaborate with peers and incorporate feedback to deliver a multimedia presentation to a professional audience with confidence. The subject also includes a work-integrated learning component to promote the development of skills, knowledge, and attributes.

For students who complete their clinical training in a NSW public hospital, the necessary legislative requirements will be part of their employment conditions. Clinical training for many of the students will be in a private setting, where the necessary requirements (which are likely to differ from public institutions) will be addressed as needed. Training for some students will occur in states other than NSW (where legislative requirements can be competed if, and when required).
