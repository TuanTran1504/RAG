- This program applies to students who commenced in 2022 or later.
- Students should follow the program structure for the session start date relevant to the year they commenced.
- For Commencement Year 2020 - 2021 - please refer to 3764.1 Bachelor of Science/ Bachelor of International Studies
- For Commencement Year 2016 - 2019 - please refer to 3660.6 Bachelor of Science/ Bachelor of International Studies
- This double degree program is designed for students who want to combine their interest and expertise in science with a sophisticated understanding of international issues and systems. This will equip them to work in globalised science-based professions and industries. In the Science area, students can design their own academic program within the Bachelor of Science program structure, which must include a science testamur major selected from the following: Zoology, Animal Science, Biology, Microbiology, Nutrition and Food Science, Forensic Biology, Forensic Chemistry, Mathematics, Data Science, Applied Physics, Chemistry, Sustainable Environmental Futures
- This will be combined with a degree in International Studies that examines the relationships of societies, cultures, languages and systems of government within the international system. It develops students’ capacity to analyse the historical development of relations among nation states and contemporary political, social and cultural issues, such as globalisation, transnationalism and migration. Students complete a major in International Relations and Asian Studies, and a minor in any Asian language, Arabic, Chinese, Indonesian, or Japanese.
- Students in this double degree also have the opportunity to complete a semester of study overseas and receive advanced standing towards their IRAS Major and language minor subject to WSU limits on advanced standing. Students are encouraged to do so but must discuss this with a B.IS or BA course advisor first.
- Students should note that not all majors and units are available at all campuses and travel between campuses may be required.
- Study Mode
- Four years full-time or eight years part-time.
