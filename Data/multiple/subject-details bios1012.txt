The subject will study the fundamental processes through which key biomolecules, including lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids and nucleic acids are manipulated to generate and store energy, and build a broad array of important biological macromolecules including DNA, membranes and proteins.  To sustain life, cells respire for energy and replicate for growth and sexual reproduction.  Accordingly the subject will examine cellular respiration, transcription, translation, mitosis, meiosis, transmission and how genes are inherited and modified providing insight into the phenomena of life.  The role of DNA technologies in the fields of medicine, biotechnology and environmental science will provide students with real world applications.
