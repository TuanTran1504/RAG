- Western Sydney University Minor Code:
- Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) are the enabling disciplines that have pushed us into a technological revolution that is seeing the boundaries between the physical, digital and biological worlds blur. When technology blends with biology we have the promise of a future world where we can all have healthier, more equitable and more productive lives. This takes transdisciplinary, innovative thinking, and an understanding of how humans interact with the world and the technology that can shape it. Students in this minor will learn how different disciplines combine to generate the thinking and creativity required to innovate and develop advanced products and innovations that can benefit humankind.
- This minor is a Challenge Minor, which is an innovative transdisciplinary minor co-created with students as partners. With a Challenge Minor, your learning reaches beyond your discipline, giving you the chance to amplify your learning in new directions. For more information, visit the Challenge Minor website.
