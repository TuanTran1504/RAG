Academic Handbook Current Edition CART 6002 Reading and Writing Australia Credit Points 10 Coordinator George Haddad Opens in new window Description This subject will be a course of reading, taking in a variety of Australian narratives across the countryâ€™s long cultural history. Students will look at art, oral storytelling, film, fiction, poetry and non-fiction, and use these texts as a jumping-off point or inspiration for their own work, simultaneously finding themselves in and creating new spaces in Australian narrative. The subject will consider Indigenous storying, urban and regional literatures, colonial legacies and how these shape aesthetics and narratives of belonging. Does Australia have a national literature, and if so, what does it mean to writers and readers in the 21st century? School Humanities & Comm Arts Discipline Creative Arts, Not Elsewhere Classified.
