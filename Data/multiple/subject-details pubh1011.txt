All health professionals should seek opportunities to promote health equity and social justice, to support healthy lifestyle choices and to connect communities with appropriate health and social services. To do this effectively, health professionals must work collaboratively with communities. This subject focuses on theories and principles that support community-centred transformative action in health promotion, and how to apply them in various local, national and global contexts. Students will be introduced to concepts and practice related to community engagement, participation, development and empowerment; community capacity and resilience-building. There will also be a focus on community identity, social justice and ethical considerations associated with working with communities. Particular focus is made on approaches to working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander peoples, marginalised and vulnerable communities.
