- This minor offers a concentrated study in health promotion for any Western student. Health Promotion extends beyond raising awareness of healthcare issues. It also involves developing and implementing strategies for communities, individuals and policy makers to support good health and wellbeing. Health promotion addresses health inequities in communities, links individuals and communities with healthcare, and assists individuals and communities to follow healthy behaviours, working across sectors and engaging collaboratively with communities to do so.
- Note: The minor is available to any student who meets its subjects’ pre-requisite rules and is not enrolled in another health promotion specialisation of the Bachelor of Health Science. Whilst identified on a student’s academic transcript, the Minor is not specified on the testamur.
