Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 7167 Primary English and Literacy 3 Credit Points 10 Coordinator Jacqueline D'Warte Opens in new window Description The focus on this subject is the exploration and critical evaluation of the teaching of English and Literacy across K-6 classrooms. This subject recognises that language, discourses, and text shape students’ interactions with our complex world and how we can teach students in K-6 to understand how meaning is shaped, conveyed, interpreted, and reflected. Contemporary pedagogical practices of teaching English with reference to National Literacy Progressions will be explored. There is strong emphasis on critical and creative understanding of approaches to develop literacy in K-6 with attention to understanding, interpreting, and creating texts with a wide range of diverse learners. A wide range of children’s literature will be used with particular focus given to the selection and use of rich Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander literature in teaching English. The subject provides opportunities for pre-service teachers to understand, critique and apply current literacy approaches that deliver successful outcomes for students.
