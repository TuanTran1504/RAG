Academic Handbook Current Edition LAWS 3015 Cyber Law and Justice Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 201018 Coordinator David Tait Opens in new window Description The world is being transformed by digital technologies.  The same technologies that make life more comfortable for some can unleash violence and destruction for others. Cyber war and cyber terrorism offer new risks for the international community. Bullying, identity theft and bank fraud, on a more local level, are given a new life in the cyber world.  Cyber technologies also provide enhanced opportunities for detecting and apprehending criminals, resolving disputes and modernising justice processes. New social spaces are opened up (social media networks, the 'dark web'), and new identities made possible (online grooming profile, avatars). How does the law keep up with the emergence of new crimes and technology-enhanced versions of old ones, and how do the cultural worlds of hackers, crackers and trackers work?  The subject examines how justice processes and spaces, as well as criminal networks and strategies, are being reimagined to take advantage of the new technologies.
