Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 1007 Brave New World: Negotiating Social Change in the 21st Century Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 101886 Coordinator Mubashar Hasan Opens in new window Description The discipline of Sociology has witnessed a transformation reflecting significant changes in society and social life. This subject re-examines the sociological dimensions of a variety of social concerns, for example: environmental issues, global migration, health, religion, indigeneity, gender, ethnic conflict and sub-cultural groups and asks: In the 'brave new world' of contemporary society we need to re-evaluate the conventional sociological concern of social structure and inequality in the face of these broad social changes. This subject will examine the social transformations which characterise contemporary social life; in particular the pace of social change and the implications of social media. In exploring these social concerns the links are drawn between more recent theoretical constructs and the more traditional focus on national social structures and inequalities. The subject will place special emphasis on concepts such as risk, individualism and uncertainty.
