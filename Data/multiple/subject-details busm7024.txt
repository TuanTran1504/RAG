Contemporary human resource development is studied within the context of strategic employment relations, challenges around talent management, the evolution of training and development in firms and in public institutions, and with some consideration of organisational learning.  By working through stakeholder differences and labour market segments, students argue as they apply knowledge to different contexts. Through argument and application comes insight into critical perspectives on building human capability, career management and development, and current and future trends in human resource development in a number of countries.
