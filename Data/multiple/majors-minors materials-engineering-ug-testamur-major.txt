- Since the dawning of mankind an understanding of how materials can be obtained and used has been critical to successful human endeavour. Materials engineers are concerned with the highly technological and dynamic process of understanding, developing, and applying materials (metals, polymers, ceramics, composites) to a range of engineering problems. Students will develop skills necessary to synthesise relevant information so that they can be effective decision makers in a materials context. These skills will serve them well in varied career opportunities associated with biomedical devices, nanotechnology, advanced manufacturing, opto-electronics, energy, aerospace, and sustainable construction. This major includes a mandatory 300 to 450 hour industrial placement as a completion requirement.
