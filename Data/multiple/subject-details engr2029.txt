Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 2029 Simulation in Virtual and Augmented Realities Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301306 Coordinator James Berry Opens in new window Description Simulation in three-dimensional (3D) environments provide valuable insights to human-centred perspectives. Whilst investigating the fundamentals of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), students will analyse aspects of functionality, user interfaces, spatial relationships in built environments, sustainability, efficient resource management, instructional support for safety and training, and accelerated design conceptualisation in detailed new product, service or environmental innovation. Students' experiences will equip them for future employment as VR and AR experience designers, interactive experience producers, or creative technologists.
