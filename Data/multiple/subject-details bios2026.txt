Academic Handbook Current Edition BIOS 2026 Molecular Biology Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300817 Coordinator Liza Cubeddu Opens in new window Description Molecular biology is central to many fields of the biomedical and natural sciences, and includes genetics, immunology, cell biology, biochemistry, and forensics. Through comparative studies of different organisms, this subject will describe fundamental concepts and methods in the study of DNA and RNA and the application of molecular biology in  advanced fields such as genomics. Subjects will include DNA replication; transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of gene expression; microarrays, and an introduction to bioinformatics. Practical work will provide opportunities to become familiar with the methods of molecular biology, with an emphasis on the development of problem solving and analytical skills School Science Discipline Biochemistry and Cell Biology Student Contribution Band HECS Band 2 10cp Check your fees via the Fees page.
