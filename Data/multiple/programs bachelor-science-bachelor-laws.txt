- The Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Laws double degree program allows graduates to span both the legal and scientific worlds in a way that single degree graduates cannot. It provides students with the capacity for critical analysis and independent thinking. The double degrees permit students to undertake multi-skilling, and offer diverse career paths providing high marketability in multiple areas of expertise. The Bachelor of Laws (LLB) provides students with professional legal skills including the ability to analyse legal material and understand fundamental legal principles; an understanding of the relationship between law and society; the skills to analyse and solve legal and non-legal problems and specialised study into the Australian legal system. The science component gives students the skills necessary for quantification, and scientific problem solving.
