BIM has the potential to improve integration between design and construction processes, reduce design discrepancies and rework, optimise project time and cost performance, and manage risks. Students will develop an understanding of the generation, reviewing and application of 3D, 4D and 5D BIM models in building projects including aspects of BIM execution plans, cost and schedule integration, and document management. This subject will be taught through intensive practice-based workshops and computing labs, enabling students to build skills in virtual design and construction processes.
