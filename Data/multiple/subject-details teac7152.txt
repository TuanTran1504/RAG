Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 7152 Applied Robotics and Programming in Secondary STEM Education Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102763 Coordinator Adam Watson Opens in new window Description This subject develops in-service teachers' knowledge and skills in the application of robotics and coding in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines. The subject content and assessments are designed to firstly build teachers' foundational skills in robotics/coding, and secondly, build teachers' professional skills in the implementation of robotics/coding in their classrooms. A particular focus of the subject is how robotics/coding can be used to authentically integrate curriculum content from and across the different STEM disciplines through inquiry- and problem-based learning, with the ultimate aim of enhancing student engagement and achievement in the STEM disciplines.
