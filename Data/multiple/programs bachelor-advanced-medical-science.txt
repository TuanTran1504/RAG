- This program applies to students who commenced in 2022 or later.
- Students should follow the program structure for the session start date relevant to the year they commenced.
- For Commencement Year 2020 to 2021 - Please refer to 3758.1 Bachelor of Advanced Medical Science
- This degree equips students with both specialised knowledge and enhanced inquiry and critical thinking skills. It provides training for a range of careers in medical science and allows development of leadership and research skills. The advanced science subjects partner you with experienced academic researchers in human nutrition, biomedical science or anatomy and physiology. The biomedical science major focuses on the cellular, molecular and genetic aspects of health. The Human Nutrition major uses biology, chemistry and physiology to develop concepts in food and nutrient form and function in relation to human metabolism and physiology, while the Anatomy and Physiology major focuses on the structure and function of the human body.
- All students must complete 60 credit points of study at Level 3 to meet course requirements. Students prior to 2024 start may need to select at least 10 credit points of flexible study at Level 3 to meet this requirement.
- Students should note that different majors are offered on different campuses.
- Study Mode
- Three years full-time or six years part-time.

- Work Integrated Learning
- Work integrated learning is a component of many subjects in the core of the course and testamur majors.Additionally, students may choose one of two specific work integrated learning subjects.
- The first of these, Complex Case Studies in Science, is designed to provide students with opportunities for personal development, industry and civic engagement and to develop career readiness. The subject
- Admission
- Assumed Knowledge: Students should have at least 2 unit English, 2 unit science (any science) and 2 unit mathematics at year 12 equivalent.
- Minimum ATAR of 90. Students must maintain a Grade Point Average of (GPA) of 5.0 or above to continue their enrolment in the program. If this GPA is not maintained they will be automatically transferred into the standard program after one warning (one semester of further study). Students in other WSU science programs who achieve a GPA of 5.0 or greater at the end of their first year of study may be admitted into the Advanced Medical Science program by invitation if sufficient places are available.
