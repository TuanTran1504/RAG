Academic Handbook Current Edition BUSM 3031 International Business Strategy Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200626 Coordinator Shveta Sharma Opens in new window Description In an environment where operating internationally is becoming the norm rather than the exception, firms are faced with ever increasing complexity when formulating their business strategy.  This requires an understanding of how firms become and remain international, the basic modes of international involvement, the practice of multinational management and how firms can establish a balance between the sometimes conflicting demands of headquarters, the subsidiary and the governments of all the countries where the multinational enterprise operates.  This subject will cover these issues and will deal with both large and small companies that must be global to survive.
