Academic Handbook Current Edition LANG 1016 Introduction to Literary Studies (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700288 Coordinator Elisha Barrett Opens in new window Description This subject involves the close reading of literary texts to explore concepts about meaning-making including the use of language, narrative form, and issues of genre. The subject asks questions about the role and function of literature. For example: is literature's purpose to entertain readers, to provide them with emotional release, to represent the world, or to allow people to make meaning from their experience? The primary texts span three genres - fiction, poetry and drama. Students will learn about the different ways in which these literary forms are constructed and the contrasting ways in which they represent reality.
