This project-based subject focuses on principles of neuromorphic algorithm design and hardware-friendly neural architecture design for neuromorphic information processors. This subject consists of two streams of research: applied event-based algorithms and bio-inspired spiking networks. Through solving increasingly challenging tasks using distributed, event-based competitive processing elements, students will learn the differences between conventional and neuromorphic algorithm design, critically assessing real-world problems in a structured manner.
