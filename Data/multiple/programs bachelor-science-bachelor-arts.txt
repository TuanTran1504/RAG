- This double degree program is designed for students whose interests span the Arts and Sciences. It will produce versatile graduates who can work across a range of academic and professional disciplines, including the opportunity to develop global perspectives and communication skills in an Asian language. In the Science area, students can design their own academic program within the Bachelor of Science course structure, which must include a Science testamur major selected from a the following: Zoology, Animal Science, Biology. Chemistry, Applied Physics, Sustainable Environmental Futures, AgriFood or Innovative Foods. This qualification in science can be combined with one of the following majors: International Relations and Asian Studies; Cultural and Social Analysis; English; History and Political Thought; Philosophy; Indigenous Australian Studies; Arabic, Chinese; Japanese; Indonesian; Islamic Studies: Linguistics; Psychological Studies.

- For the Science degree, work integrated learning is a component of many subjects in the core of the course and testamur majors. Students must study to a specific work integrated learning subject, Complex Case Studies in Science. This subject is designed to provide students with opportunities for personal development, industry and civic engagement and to develop career readiness. The subject assures that students can critically analyse and logically argue complex scientific issues whilst taking into account multiple competing perspectives and builds on employability and communication skills developed in earlier subjects.
- There is a mandatory work component required for completion of this program.  Please contact the Program Advisor listed above for information.
- International students should also refer to the link below for more information and a link to the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS).
