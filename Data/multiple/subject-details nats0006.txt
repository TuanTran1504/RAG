Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 0006 Fundamentals of Health Science (WSTC Prep) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700190 Coordinator Ryan Sidoti Opens in new window Description The depth of knowledge and practical skills required by health professionals in the 21st century is very different to that which was required in the past.  Medical treatment of illness and disease has become increasingly technical and health professionals are expected to work in partnership in determining patient care.  In order to achieve this, today's health professional must have a basic understanding of the fundamental scientific principles behind health and disease.  Increasingly, modern health science is concerned with maintaining health as a way of preventing disease and this is achieved through a holistic approach to the human condition.  This subject is an introduction to the basic concepts in human body systems, health and disease, that is required in order to commence any tertiary health science course.
