Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 7005 Advanced Academic English Skills Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102325 Coordinator Dariush Izadi Opens in new window Description This is a language-analysis intensive subject with practical application for real situational English language teaching. It offers students theoretical overviews of language analysis, from the sentential-clausal-lexical-grammatical level to highly contextualised discourse study. It requires students to engage with a variety of real-life instances of language use while also investigating the potentialities of extensive linguistic repertoires. By exposing students to both the realities of actual language use and the possibilities inherent in varieties of English, students are better prepared for the demands of English (second and foreign) language teaching across multiple contexts.
