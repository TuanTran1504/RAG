Academic Handbook Current Edition EART 2004 Soils and Substrates Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301446 Coordinator Jason Reynolds Opens in new window Description This subject provides you with a basic understanding of soil formation and erosion processes, soil physical, chemical and biological properties, and the diversity and classification of soils in the Australian landscape. These basic principles, along with alternative substrates, are explored in relation to the sustainable management of soils and substrates for horticultural and agricultural production and for environmental management and other land uses. The practical sessions are designed to reinforce the lecture material and include field description and analysis of soil profiles and properties, soil sampling principles and practice, laboratory measurement of soil and substrate physical and chemical properties essential/important for plant growth, soil/substrate biology.
