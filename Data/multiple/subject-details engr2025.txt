Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 2025 Design Graphics: Engineering Documentation Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301287 Coordinator Michael Chapman Opens in new window Description Current and future growth in the areas of product design, virtual reality, and high technology innovation industries require a foundation and working knowledge of 3D computer modelling. In this subject students will be introduced to 3D modelling software and the fundamental principles of current Australian Standards for engineering drawing and documentation. The skills gained will contribute to preparation for future complex projects in engineering, industrial design and creative industries that require prototyping, files for additive manufacturing (3D printing), and component designs that can perform at exact specifications and standards.
