- The Bachelor of Building Design Management (Honours) program develops essential skills crucial for excelling in the integrated design and delivery of building projects. Encompassing all facets of building design, it begins with an initial design concept, extends to the formation of a design brief, oversees project documentation, ensures quality control management during the construction phase, and culminates in a project handover.
- Students will develop an understanding of ‘buildability’ issues, accurate cost forecasting, risk management and sustainable project delivery. Students will also develop skills needed to work in a multi-disciplinary project team and negotiate favourable outcomes in complex project environments through simulations of real-life building projects and approved practical experiences. Graduates of the program will be well-prepared for roles as Design Coordinators or Design Administrators, with a clear pathway to becoming Design Managers at large construction contractors.
