Academic Handbook Current Edition COMM 3022 Media Memory Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 101931 Coordinator Adam Daniel Opens in new window Description Media memory is now a critical field of study in journalism, advertising, visual communication and media. The media builds local, national and transnational identities through the representation of the past. Media industries such as advertising rely upon collective memories to design campaigns in order to reach particular audiences. Journalists increasingly 'assemble' stories from digital archives, recombining similar or related events from the past to build stories and features of the present. Individuals increasingly contribute to news events through their own 'witnessing' of events, capturing and sharing material using mobile and social media. This subject addresses these processes by providing a brief history and overview of approaches to thinking about media and memory, in the context of the significance of media convergence and digital memory within contemporary media ecologies. The subject provides students with a series of case studies that approach the memory of particular events, drawing on examples from advertising, public relations, visual communication, animation, film, broadcasting and journalism. Students develop a media research project that engages with the material presented in the subject.
