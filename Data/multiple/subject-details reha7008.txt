Academic Handbook Current Edition REHA 7008 Introduction to Podiatry and Clinical Education Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400942 Coordinator Stefania Penkala Opens in new window Description This is the first subject to introduce Master's entry students to some basic theoretical and practical components related to podiatric practice with an emphasis on clinical competencies in patient communication and management that will be reinforced in the one week clinical placement in either a private practice or public sector setting. In addition, a clinical component will introduce students to skills required to treat basic skin conditions and evaluate the functional anatomy, gait and cursory examination as well as communication skills which are necessary components for the Podiatric Practice clinical subjects. Furthermore, general clinical treatment techniques will be covered such as chair side devices, strapping and removable pads to more complex skills such as the manufacture of non-cast orthotic devices will be covered.
