Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 3043 Advanced Science Research Project C Credit Points 20 Legacy Code 301258 Coordinator Bill Price Opens in new window Description This is a 20 credit point year-long subject taken over two terms (10 credit points in each term). This subject provides a unique opportunity for Advanced Science and Advanced Medical Science students to work with and be mentored by academics in diverse areas of science.  In this 20 credit point subject, students will complete a small research project aligned with the research activity of the academic and be integrated into the research environment of the School.  Students will demonstrate time management skills, project design, data collection, analysis and communication.  Students will be required to reflect on their capacity and areas of passion for transitioning into either further education or the workplace.  Please note this subject is not timetabled so completion will be subject to approved timelines negotiated with the appropriate academic staff and subject co-ordinator. Students may be required to travel to a different campus or location to undertake this subject. School Science Discipline Natural and Physical Sciences, Not Elsewhere Classified.
