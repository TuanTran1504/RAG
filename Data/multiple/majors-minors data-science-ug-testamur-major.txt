- Data is ubiquitous, and analysing data plays an increasingly important role in many careers. Data Science is based on mathematics and statistics, but there is more to it: a Data Scientist has the required expertise to convert all forms of data into valuable information. Building on the Bachelor of Mathematics, this major equips graduates with additional skills and knowledge for designing experimental studies, building and fitting of models, visualisation, estimation and prediction, storage and retrieval of big data. Such skills are essential for tasks such as the analysis of customer transactions and behaviour, scientific investigations, financial trends, and online behaviour.
