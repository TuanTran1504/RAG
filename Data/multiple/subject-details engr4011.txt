Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 4011 Sustainability and Risk Engineering Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300798 Coordinator Dharma Hagare Opens in new window Description Analysis of sustainability with engineering perspectives is increasingly becoming important in the modern world. Also, often the risk analysis is required to be carried for true sustainable solutions. Engineers with in-depth understanding of different tools that can be used for both sustainability and risk analysis will have significant edge in their future career.  The students will discuss and understand various engineering issues including renewable/alternative energy systems, energy/resource efficiency, sustainable/green buildings, sustainable transport and infrastructure, sustainable water management, environmental management systems, sustainability reporting, life cycle analysis, probability/reliability theory, risk assessment models and, overall system analysis.
