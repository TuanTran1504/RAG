Academic Handbook Current Edition ELEC 6004 Neuromorphic Electronics Design Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 800229 Coordinator Ying Xu Opens in new window Description Efficient, parallel, low-power computation is a hallmark of brain computation and the goal of neuromorphic engineering. The focus of this subject is to design, implement and test accurate, electronic, very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuit model of neural systems and the associated signal processing. Students will have opportunities to design and build a neural system on hardware and gain resultant insights into applying neuromorphic engineering to real-world problems.
This subject will be undertaken at Parramatta City - Hassall St campus.
