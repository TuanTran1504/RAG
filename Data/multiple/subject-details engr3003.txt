Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 3003 Biomedical Electronics Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301122 Coordinator Gaetano Gargiulo Opens in new window Description This subject will cover recent advances in biomedical electronics including electronic diagnostic devices, implanted devices, human-computer-interface, bioinstrumentation and neuromorphic engineering. Topics covered span from the bio-electromagnetism and related applications to regulatory aspects (IEC standards and TGA/FDA approval processes) and electrical safety of instrumentation. This subject will have a strong practical design focus with laboratories and tutorials focused on the design of real instrumentation (including manufacturing) dealing with real biomedical signals.
