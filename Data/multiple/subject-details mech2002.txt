Academic Handbook Current Edition MECH 2002 Kinematics and Kinetics of Machines (WSTC AssocD) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700244 Coordinator Abbas Ranjbar Opens in new window Description Kinematics is the study of the motion of objects, and Kinetics is the study of the causes of the motion. The focus for this subject is on rigid body kinematics, which involves the study of a solid body with little or no deformation in planar motion, such as those in machines. The motion of key machine components and the forces they generate gives rise to design problems. Students gain an understanding of the relevance of kinematics and kinetics in the analysis and design of mechanical systems and of methods to ensure machines operate efficiently and safely.
