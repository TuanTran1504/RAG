- Western Sydney University Major Code:
- Previous Code: MT3050.1
- Engineers are leaders in developing novel approaches to solving the biggest challenges faced by environmental and interrelated systems. In this Major, students assess the impact of industrial development then propose design solutions using holistic, futuristic and sustainable technologies and strategies. Through hands-on, real-life projects, students explore solutions that integrate technical, technological (IoT), social, cultural, geographical, regulatory and ethical factors particularly in relation to water, air and land. This major will benefit students aiming for careers such as Environmental Engineer/Scientist/Consultant, Natural Resources Manager, Waste Engineer/Manger/ Consultant, and Sustainability Engineer/ Manager/ Consultant. All students complete a mandatory industrial placement.
