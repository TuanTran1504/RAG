Academic Handbook Current Edition BEHV 7001 Advanced Therapeutic Modalities Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102361 Coordinator Tania Perich Opens in new window Description This subject follows from 102360 Core Therapeutic Modalities. Students in this subject will develop foundational skills in assessment, case formulation and treatment planning through understanding and developing skills in further evidence-based psychological therapies that may be modified based on an evolving case formulation and evaluation and tailored to the client as appropriate to their wider social and cultural context.  Further, students will be guided in critical examination of similarities and differences across those therapeutic approaches and their application across conditions, populations, settings and cultural contexts.  Please note: some of the activities in this subject may include experiential learning, for example where students may be asked to take on the client role using their own lived experience, to provide opportunity for training in therapeutic modalities that are more "real life". Students may opt-out of these activities without consequence through speaking to the subject coordinator and alternative arrangements for student learning opportunities will be organised.
