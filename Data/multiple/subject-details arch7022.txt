Academic Handbook Current Edition ARCH 7022 Architecture Studio Spring Intensive Credit Points 10 Coordinator Michael Chapman Opens in new window Description This subject will introduce students to real world adaptive re-use design scenarios in an intensive and site-based manner. Architecture Studio Spring Intensive focuses on industrial or urban heritage sites at a range of scales, giving students exposure to issues of recycling, whole life carbon and heritage preservation. As well as developing skills in research and site analysis, students will be expected to develop conceptual and developed design proposals for complex adaptive re-use scenarios with an understanding of the cycles of post-industrialisation. Working in immersive multi-disciplinary design teams, students will develop an awareness of the environmental, social and structural role that architectural heritage plays in urban transformation. Students will work across a range of complex architectural sites which are sometimes derelict, contaminated, heritage-protected or in need of renewal, to learn about the role of adaptive re-use in future architectural and climate scenarios. Students will also be introduced to regulations, clients and consultants in an environment that will prepare them for working in professional architecture and design settings. In order to communicate their design to a range of audiences, students will learn skills in communication, architectural modelling, documentation and visualisation in the representation of design solutions for multiple audiences.
