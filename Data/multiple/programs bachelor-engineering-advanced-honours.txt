- The Bachelor of Engineering Advanced (Honours) is a four year honours degree program. The program has been designed to meet Engineers Australia professional accreditation requirements. Students have the opportunity to focus on a discipline area by selecting a Major in Advanced Manufacturing, Civil, Construction, Electrical, Materials, Mechanical, Robotic & Mechatronic, and Sustainability engineering. The majors of Electrical, Mechanical, and Robotics & Mechatronics engineering are offered within the WSU-UNSW Collaborative Program (see below). In addition, students can specialise by selecting a Minor from a wide range of recommended subject sets that will complement their chosen discipline. Students in this program will need to maintain a minimum GPA of 5.0 at the end of completion of 160 credit points, and again at the completion of 200 credit points; those not meeting this academic performance requirement will be transferred to Bachelor of Engineering (Honours).
- WSU-UNSW Collaborative Program
- The WSU-UNSW Collaborative Program is exclusive to the Bachelor of Engineering Advanced (Honours) degree and offers three majors; Electrical, Mechanical and Robotics & Mechatronics engineering. UNSW academics deliver 5 subjects into this Program, with each major including 3 UNSW delivered subjects. Students who achieve a GPA of 5.7 or above at the completion of 2 years (160 cp) of study will be eligible to transfer to UNSW to complete the remainder of their studies and graduate with a UNSW Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree (subject to meeting the threshold requirements for student transfer). Students not transferring to UNSW will continue their studies at WSU in the Bachelor of Engineering Advanced (Honours) degree of their selected major.
