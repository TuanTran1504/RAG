- The Undergraduate Certificate in Disability Care Support provides an introduction to the health sciences, focusing on the disability care sector. Disability support workers might find themselves working in either a community setting, a clients’ home, and are required to provide support in order to empower people with disabilities to achieve greater levels of independence, self-reliance, community participation, and wellbeing. Demand for skilled workers in all facets of the community services industry is growing. Specifically, the introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is driving demand for person-centred support.
