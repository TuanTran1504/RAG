Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 2033 Issues in World Development: Rich World, Poor World (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700267 Coordinator Mona Shrestha Opens in new window Description This subject introduces students to the field of international development, where the divide between the rich world and poor world takes a centre stage. While development has created prosperity around the world, it is not without discontents. Social and economic inequality at the global level is a real problem and has been increasing. The 'developed' and 'developing' world paradigm will be critically examined. Students will be equipped with theories and case studies examining development, underdevelopment and their related issues within a contemporary political, economic and social framework. Students will also have exposure to current global development debates such as poverty, global inequality, sustainable development, democracy and security.
