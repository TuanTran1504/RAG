Academic Handbook Current Edition LAWS 3083, Gender and the Law Credit Points 10 Coordinator Amira Aftab Opens in new window Description This subject examines the way in which law and gender interact to produce gendered outcomes. The subject draws on feminist and queer theories to challenge traditional concepts of gender and notions of law as gender neutral.  The subject will consider the way in which gender constructs influence the development and application of law. Students will study historical and contemporary legal issues to examine the way that gendered norms emerge and operate within the legal system, reproducing and reinforcing socially and politically constructed understandings of gender and sexuality. Students will be encouraged to think about the potential for law as a site of change and a means to promote gender equality.
