Academic Handbook Current Edition AGEN 7004 Perspectives of Sustainable Development Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300397 Coordinator Richard Thomas Opens in new window Description This subject explores the philosophy, policies and practice of sustainable development.  In exploring environmental philosophy the subject provides students with an understanding of the nature and emergence of both modern and post-modern paradigms that influence the direction and nature of current development policy.  The nature of environmental policy is examined by developing an understanding of how values and attitudes shape a governing ethic about environmental management. The social, political, economic and ecological elements of sustainable development are unfolded to aid students understanding of what needs to be managed.  Particular attention is given to those issues confronting developing countries as they move to become industrialised nations yet have high levels of poverty.  Finally, the subject introduces the practice of environmental impact assessment as one management tool used in the management process.
