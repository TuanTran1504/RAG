This experience will allow the student to develop the necessary skills and competencies expected of high performing health professionals. The Internship enables a focused opportunity to work in contemporary healthcare settings with leaders and managers from a variety of professions. Students will also engage in coursework with a focus on creating an portfolio that revisits all content learned throughout their courses to critically assess their learning journey and learning outcomes. This process will teach students how to systematically self-reflect in deep and transformative ways, engaging with theory and knowledge acquired and developed through their studies to design and create a portfolio of their skills and competencies through a social capital framework. The subject will culminate in a presentation of the results of their internship project in a research and practice seminar. School Health Sciences Discipline Health, Not Elsewhere Classified.
