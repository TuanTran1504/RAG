Teaching includes both theory and practice with reference to real world contexts highlighting future career opportunities in a convergent digital media and business world, including a good understanding of basic business issues complemented by a high level of knowledge relevant to the specific discipline. Through classwork, independent study and engagement with the multicultural nature of our communities, students develop an understanding of the local and international relevance of their chosen studies, with opportunities to develop and produce a range of media outcomes as applied research and professional projects throughout their studies. Students complete a capstone unit in engaged learning that equips them as ‘business ready’ in terms of dealing with real world business issues and problems and generating real world business solutions. Through self-directed, team-based and problem-based learning strategies requiring active participation in the community and professional contexts, graduates learn to reflect and value ethical and intellectual conduct as well as respect for diversity and social justice principles.
