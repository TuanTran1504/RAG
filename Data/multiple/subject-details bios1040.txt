Academic Handbook Current Edition BIOS 1040 Natural Science (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Coordinator Anne Bertoldo Opens in new window Description This subject delves into the rich tapestry of biodiversity, uncovering the myriad of living organisms that inhabit our planet and their intricate roles within ecosystems. In this subject, you will explore and classify biodiversity and the mechanisms through which organisms grow, reproduce, and utilise resources. You will learn about the process of evolution and how evolution has given rise to the diversity of organisms in the biosphere. You will also observe the natural interactions between living organisms and Earthâ€™s ecosystems, recognising that these very interactions have been pivotal in driving evolutionary changes. As you progress, you will gain insights into the importance of sustainable engagement with biodiversity, upon which the future of human survival depends.
