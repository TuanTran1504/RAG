Academic Handbook Current Edition COMP 2023 Mathematical Programming Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301375 Coordinator Roozbeh Hazrat Opens in new window Description This subject will introduce the programming language Python, through which students will explore and investigate practical mathematical problems.  Python is one of the most powerful versatile programming languages, and it is increasingly used by engineers and scientists as well as banks and financial institutions to tackle their computational problems.  The subject promotes an experimental side of mathematics and will employ Python-based computational tools to gain insight and intuition into problems, to discover mathematical patterns and relationships, and to use visualisation techniques to expose mathematical structures.
