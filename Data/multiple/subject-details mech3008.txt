Academic Handbook Current Edition MECH 3008 Thermodynamics and Heat Transfer Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300760 Coordinator Ming Zhao Opens in new window Description This subject introduces students to the fundamentals of thermodynamics which involves energy in the form of heat and heat transfer. Students explore the basic laws and properties of thermodynamics to discover how energy is converted and transferred. Students will apply their knowledge to evaluate power and refrigeration cycles, industrial devices, as well as to design a simple industrial device.
