- The Master of Science is an advanced program that can be taken in a number of specialisations: Public Health Nutrition, Food Science, Greenhouse Horticulture, Agriculture or Sustainable Water Futures. The program builds on studentsâ€™ professional experience and/or prior qualifications to develop advanced expertise and critical understanding in science and in these disciplines. The program is completed with a capstone subject that is designed to integrate the various themes that flow throughout the program and develop research and project design skills in science. Depending on the specialisation, students may find employment at a senior level in a wide range of destinations, including federal, state and local government bodies, universities, research organisations, food and agriculture industries, private companies, health facilities, science-based industries, or private consultancies.
- Students should note that travel to different campuses may be required depending on the specialisation chosen.
- Early Exits
- Students may exit this program on completion of 40 credit points with a 3776 Graduate Certificate in Science (exit only) or on completion of 80 credit points with a 3777 Graduate Diploma in Science (exit only)
- Study Mode
- Two years full-time or the equivalent part-time. Students will be required to attend the Hawkesbury campus for some learning experiences.
