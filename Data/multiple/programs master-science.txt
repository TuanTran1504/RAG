- The Master of Science is an advanced program that can be taken in a number of specialisations: Public Health Nutrition, Food Science, Greenhouse Horticulture, Agriculture or Sustainable Water Futures. The program builds on students’ professional experience and/or prior qualifications to develop advanced expertise and critical understanding in science and in these disciplines. The program is completed with a capstone subject that is designed to integrate the various themes that flow throughout the program and develop research and project design skills in science. Depending on the specialisation, students may find employment at a senior level in a wide range of destinations, including federal, state and local government bodies, universities, research organisations, food and agriculture industries, private companies, health facilities, science-based industries, or private consultancies.
- Students should note that travel to different campuses may be required depending on the specialisation chosen.
- Early Exits
- Students may exit this program on completion of 40 credit points with a 3776 Graduate Certificate in Science (exit only) or on completion of 80 credit points with a 3777 Graduate Diploma in Science (exit only)
- Study Mode
- Two years full-time or the equivalent part-time. Students will be required to attend the Hawkesbury campus for some learning experiences.

- International students should be aware that if an elective is a requirement of the course but the work itself was not registered with CRICOS, students can still complete these electives but it would be counted towards the work limitation. For more details, refer to the 'Work Integrated Learning (WIL) for international students' website.
- The course uses workplaces as a source of learning, with site excursions for some Specialisations. Some students may undertake an industry project as part of 301374 Professional Topic or 301361 Industry Project or 301362 Industry Project Extended. Students will be supervised on site visits by arrangement with the industry partner and overseen by an academic staff member.
