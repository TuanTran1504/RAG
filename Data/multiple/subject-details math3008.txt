Students will carry out a project under the supervision of an academic staff member. Assisted by their supervisor, students will define the problem to be studied and then acquire, develop and apply the appropriate theory or methodology. They will prepare a final report presenting theoretical results or methodology, an analysis and a discussion followed by an appropriate conclusion, as well as a literature review or a list of references as appropriate. Students will also give a talk on their project. School Computer, Data & Math Sciences Student Contribution Band HECS Band 1 10cp Check your fees via the Fees page.
