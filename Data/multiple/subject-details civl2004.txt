While the main focus will remain on incompressible fluids, effects of compressible fluids will also be discussed.  The theories learned in classes will be reinforced in laboratory sessions.Offerings of alternate subjects are dependent on there being sufficient student enrolment numbers. If enrolments are low, the College may cancel delivery of the alternate subject.
