Academic Handbook Current Edition MECH 2003 Mechanics of Materials Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300040 Coordinator Baolin Wang Opens in new window Description Mechanics of Materials is the study of the stresses and deformation of a body made of any elastic solid material, and how these are related to the body's shape and the load applied to it. This subject looks at how and why structural components including bars and beams deform and break. It concentrates on how these are affected by the geometry of the body and loading. Types of loadings considered include normal loads, torsional loads and bending loads. The main objective of the subject is to introduce students to the aspects of stress, strain and internal force development in the components and the methods to determine the deformation and deflections of the components. Energy methods and impact loadings are also considered.
