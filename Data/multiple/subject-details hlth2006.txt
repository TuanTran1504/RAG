Academic Handbook Current Edition HLTH 2006 Exercise Prescription for General Populations Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400326 Coordinator Chloe Taylor Opens in new window Description In 2016, this subject is replaced by 401143 - Exercise Prescription I. The exercise prescription area is designed to give students an understanding of and experience in exercise prescription and fitness program construction for the general population of all ages and both genders, including pre exercise screening and fitness testing. It will focus on the development of general health related fitness programs, which improve aerobic and anaerobic fitness, flexibility, muscular strength and endurance, including resistance training. Students will design, implement and evaluate a self-prescribed exercise program as well as provide one-to-one training sessions for fellow students.

Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Apply knowledge of the principles of exercise prescription with particular emphasis on aerobic training, resistance training, and flexibility training methods.
Describe how ageing and physical inactivity impact upon health-related physical fitness and how exercise can be used to mitigate these effects.
Describe the absolute and relative contraindications to exercise participation and criteria to terminate fitness tests of all types.
Administer and interpret a range of pre-exercise health screening tools to determine the risk for an individual and appropriate action.
Select, calibrate, implement and interpret (and modify) standard health-related physical fitness tests for low risk individuals.
