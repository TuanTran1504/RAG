Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 7056 Clinical Research in Health Science Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 800225 Coordinator Jerome Sarris Opens in new window Description This subject will teach students practical knowledge and skills for conducting clinical research within the field of Health Science. Students will learn ethical, methodological and practical considerations in applied quantitative and mixed- method research within the framework of a human clinical trial.  Upon completion of the subject students will have an understanding of basic human clinical trial design, novel clinical trial designs, specialisation within various study fields. They will also have consideration of stakeholders and translational importance, trial governance, regulations and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), intellectual property, commercialisation, recruitment, and advertising and marketing. Finally, they will understand the importance of translational impact via publications and the media, and be able to synthesise trial data via knowing how to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Utilise quantitative or mixed method trial designs (basic and novel)
Critically appraise recruitment procedures and protocols
Analyse and understand commercialisation options and understand IP considerations
Formulate ways to involve the community throughout the research process and enhance translational research impact of the research (especially via media involvement)
Utilise appropriate methods to conduct a systematic review or meta-analysis Subject Content - Overview of human clinical trial research (for natural products, integrative modalities, and pharmaceutical medicines [including IP/commercialisation considerations])
