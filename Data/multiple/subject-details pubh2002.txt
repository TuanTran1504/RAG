Academic Handbook Current Edition PUBH 2002 Approaches to Health Promotion (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700065 Coordinator Despina Kamper Opens in new window Description Health promotion is a process that seeks to enable individuals, carers, communities and populations to increase control over their health. It does so by addressing the determinants of health and equity issues, leading to improved health outcomes. Theoretical underpinnings of the various approaches to health promotion are explored in this unit. In addition, factors that enhance and limit health promotion are analysed in conjunction with bigger picture approaches of working with policy. The best evidence-based practice for health promotion is outlined together with the need to move beyond education.
