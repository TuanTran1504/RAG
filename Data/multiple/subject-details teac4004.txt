Students will analyse leadership theories and consider how the leadership role can and does influence the quality of practitionersâ€™ practices and Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) service provision. Students will reflect on their professional identity, values, experiences, knowledge and practices to develop a personal perspective of how effective leadership is enacted to lead staff teams and strengthen relationships. Students will also engage with the tenets of research as they investigate their own pedagogy and practice as emerging leaders of early education settings. Using an action research model to explore the processes of data collection, analysis techniques and literature review, students will have the opportunity to develop a portfolio in which they critically analyse their own practices and consider strategies to build their leadership capability and pedagogical practice.
