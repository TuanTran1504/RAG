Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 3026 Convicts and Settlers - Australian History 1788 - 1840 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 101799 Coordinator Carol Liston Opens in new window Description In little more than half a century Australia was transformed from a convict prison to a parliamentary democracy. The people who made this transformation were the ex-convicts, free settlers and first generation of colonial born children. The survival of data about ordinary people between 1788-1840 makes it possible to investigate families, communities, employment, law and order and the daily experiences of urban and frontier life in these formative years. Using family history resources on the internet and sophisticated digital archives of historical records in Australia and overseas, this subject will challenge assumptions about "who do you think we were?"
