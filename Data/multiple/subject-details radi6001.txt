Academic Handbook Current Edition RADI 6001 Pathophysiology in Diagnostic Ultrasound Credit Points 10 Coordinator Paul Stoodley Opens in new window Description This subject will develop a student’s understanding of the abnormal anatomical features and pathophysiological processes that underpin frequently encountered diseases within both the Australian Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in ultrasound practice. Common congenital, genetic and acquired diseases, alongside biofeedback mechanisms controlling homeostasis will be explored. Furthermore, the roles of key pharmacological agents for disease management will be examined.
