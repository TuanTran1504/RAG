Academic Handbook Current Edition ELEC 6002 Master Dissertation in Neuromorphic Engineering Credit Points 80 Legacy Code 800234 Coordinator Bharath Ramesh Opens in new window Description This is a 80 credit point year-long subject taken over two terms (40 credit points in each term). This subject is offered exclusively on campus for students to benefit from mentorships and regular interactions with leading researchers in the field. Students will have the opportunity to contribute towards impactful research projects, aiming at academic growth and progress. To achieve this goal, the Dissertation subject is designed for students to plan and execute a research-based project in the area of Neuromorphic Engineering. The main task in the year-long 80 credit point dissertation subject is an academic research paper that meets publishing standards and is peer-reviewed by external reviewers (getting the article published on a journal is not a completion requirement to the unit). The students shall be part of regular International Center for Neuromorphic Systems (ICNS) interactions, and benefit from supervisors in a discursive setting as the candidate makes progress.
