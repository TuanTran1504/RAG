- A minor in Social Research provides students with training in the methods and theories of social research for their application to social issues and social policy. In addition to interviewing and observation skills, quantitative analysis, spatial analysis, and Indigenous methodologies, the minor offers students the opportunity to apply these skills across a range of themes including ethnography, ethnicity and migration, urban planning and criminology. A Bachelor of Social Science with a minor in Social Research will prepare students for both employment and/or a research higher degree.
