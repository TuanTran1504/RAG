- This major is available as an elective in Bachelor of Science 3754, and an elective major option in Bachelor of Medical Science 3755. See the related programs tab for more information.
- Please note, the BSc Major Environmental Health T076, BSc Adv 3757, Bachelor of Science (Pathway to Teaching Primary/Secondary) 3756 & BMedSc Adv 3758, do not have sufficient Flexible space to accommodate a second/elective Major.
- Chemistry knowledge underpins all aspects of our modern society. Chemists can use an understanding of chemical structures and processes to adapt, control and manipulate systems involved in energy production, food safety, forensics, biomedical technology, and ecosystem. Indeed, there is not an area of our society that has not been impacted by chemical knowledge. At WSU we teach the theoretical and practical aspects of chemical sciences covering the sub-disciplines of physical, analytical, inorganic and organic chemistries. We have a particular focus on contemporary spectroscopy and separation methods that are required to solve big-picture problems in all areas of scientific discovery. Our graduates have opportunities to be closely mentored by experienced academics. We aim to produce scientists who are confident and self-directed, having gained independence in scientific discovery through an integrated theoretical and practical teaching programme that seeks to solve problems relating to societal needs.
