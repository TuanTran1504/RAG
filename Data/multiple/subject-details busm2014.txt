Academic Handbook Current Edition BUSM 2014 Enterprise Industrial Relations Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200614 Coordinator Terri Mylett Opens in new window Description Enterprise Industrial Relations builds participants' analytical and research abilities, developing capacity to identify, diagnose and engage with industrial relations challenges from different stakeholder perspectives. Participants work with real-world industrial relations, looking at individual employees' workplace and labour market experiences; the goals and activities of managers; and the role and practices of tribunals, enforcement agencies, employer associations and trade unions. This is done through activities that require working collaboratively on problems using online research to investigate contemporary practice, such as the drivers behind enterprise agreements and the implications of institutional arrangements and trade unions for productivity, equity and human resource utilisation. It is a core subject for the human resource management undergraduate program.
