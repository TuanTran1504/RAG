- Language majors aim to enable students to develop an appropriate level of proficiency in a second language which may be used for professional purposes such as teaching, interpreting and translation, business or international relations. Students undertaking a language major will be able to use the language in question according to its grammatical and pragmatic principles, communicate with native speakers appropriately in the spoken as well as the written mode, and demonstrate an understanding of the cultures and societies associated with the language.

- Major Structure
- There are three entry levels into language majors. Beginner’s level is for those with no previous study or minimal study of the language. Intermediate level is typically for students who: are non-native speakers with study of the language to HSC 2 Unit level or have a home background in the language but no comprehensive formal study. Post-Intermediate level is typically for students who are non-native speakers with substantial formal study and near-native competence; or are literate native speakers of the language. Students should consult with the Languages staff regarding the progression sequence that best fits their level of skill. During the first two weeks of class, the lecturer will monitor the performance of students and advise students who need to transfer to a higher or lower class. Students may consult with the Languages Course Advisor, if they are unsure of their entry level. Students should avoid enrolling in subjects at different levels at the one time (e.g. you should not enrol in LANG 2024 Japanese 201  and LANG 3051 Japanese 301  at the same time). Please check the current timetable as some subjects may not be offered every year. Advanced (Level 3) subjects may be offered on a rotational basis.
- A major in Japanese comprises a sequence of 80 credit points with 60 credit points at Levels 2 and 3 (with no less than 30 credit points of these at Level 3), however students commencing at beginners level, that is subjects LANG 1020 Japanese 101  and LANG 1021 Japanese 102, and who follow the recommended program structure, are only required to complete 20 credit points at Level 3.
- Students should take subjects that reflect their level of competence in the language and they should not backtrack, i.e. they must not:
- Level 1 Subjects
- Level 2 Subjects
- Level 3 Subjects
- Advanced entry level Japanese students may complete the following Level 1 pool subjects. The subjects will be recognised as Level 3 pool subjects for the purpose of specialisation completion.
