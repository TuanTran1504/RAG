Academic Handbook Current Edition ECON 1002 Consumers, Firms and Markets (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 700249 Coordinator Abdullah Al Aabed Opens in new window Description This subject is an introduction to microeconomics. It provides students with an understanding of basic concepts such as value, rational consumer behaviour, the behaviour of firms in various market structures, the efficiency and failings of markets, the distribution of wealth and income, and the role of government regulation and intervention. It illuminates these concepts by considering and debating their application to contemporary economic and social issues such as: the influence of marketing on consumer choices, the concentration of market power in Australian industries, rising income and wealth inequality, minimum wage laws, and governmental responses to environmental problems and climate change.
