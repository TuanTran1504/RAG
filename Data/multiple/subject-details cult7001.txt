Academic Handbook Current Edition CULT 7001 Economies and Ecologies Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 800174 Coordinator Katherine Gibson Opens in new window Description This subject examines how the economy is being reclaimed as a space of political decision in the Anthropocene, the new geological epoch in which human activity is having global impact on the Earth's ecosystems. It critically explores how different ways of thinking about economy shape the worlds we inhabit. It analyses contemporary examples of economic experimentation and human-non-human assemblages that are making 'other worlds' possible.  It explores connections between ecological and economic thinking and asks how our conception of the economy and subjectivity changes when we consider the needs of other species as well as our own.
