Academic Handbook Current Edition MATH 3006 Mathematical Modelling Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 200022 Coordinator Stephen Weissenhofer Opens in new window Description Mathematical Modelling is about solving real world problems. The real world is a complicated place which we often need or want to understand better. One way to do this is to set up a mathematical model which we hope can provide insights, predictions and a greater understanding of a complex system. Selected real-world problems are approximated by mathematical models that are amenable to being written in terms of linear and non-linear equations or differential equations.  Once equations are solved emphasis is placed on interpreting solutions, modifying models as required and using  models for prediction.
