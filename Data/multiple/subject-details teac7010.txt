Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 7010 Assessing to Support Learning Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102147 Coordinator Michelle Button Opens in new window Description Professionals' knowledge and skill in assessment supports the identification, planning, monitoring and evaluation of their work with individuals with additional needs. Assessment not only applies to assessing the needs of the individual, but extends to identifying the needs of the family and the educational setting. This subject explores various models of assessment (and their underlying theory and implications for practice). Various approaches are investigated that are utilised to elucidate a range of educational needs across the lifespan by a range of professionals (e.g. functional, standardised, diagnostic, strengths-based, curriculum-based). Students apply problem-based learning by selecting and critiquing assessment strategies to inform the goals, educational instruction and adjustments, and progress for an individual, their family and educational setting.  Students also develop skills in communicating with colleagues and families regarding issues around assessment.
