- The Bachelor of Health Science is made up of a compulsory core group of 8 subjects (80cp) that focus on the foundation knowledge and skills required by all health professionals. These subjects focus on population health, health professional competencies, communication, anatomy and physiology, human development across the lifespan, diseases, psychology, research and evidence and project development and management.

Testamur majors in Public Health, Health Promotion, Health Services Management and Recreational Therapy prepare graduates for industry-based health professional roles and course completion. Alternately, the Clinical Sciences testamur major has been designed as a pathway degree, to help students progress to post graduate study in clinical health areas.
