Academic Handbook Current Edition LANG 2033 Literature and Decolonisation Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102572 Coordinator Ben Etherington Opens in new window Description Do you know why nearly a hundred new nations were founded between 1945 and 1970? Have you ever wondered who Mahatma Gandhi or Ho Chi Minh were? Why would you challenge authority 'non-violently'? How do you write creatively in a language that has been imposed through colonial conquest? These are all questions connected to decolonisation: the explosive process by which the great modern European empires were dissolved and scores of new nations were formed - from Indonesia to Algeria, India to Nigeria, Jamaica to Vietnam. With this process came a surge of creative energy, as formerly colonised peoples set out to produce new ways of writing and thinking. We will read classic anti-colonial politicians like Gandhi and Frantz Fanon and writers from different decolonising regions including  India, Africa, South-East Asia, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Australia.
