- Western Sydney University Major Code:
- This major combines social science, business and public relations subjects to provide students with the knowledge and skills required to organise, manage and promote festivals and events. Students will learn about the social and cultural significance of festivals and events, and the roles and responsibilities of a variety of stakeholders. The major also explores the important role festivals and events play in tourism and visitor economies. Students who choose to complete the Visitor Economy Professional Placement subject will complete a work placement with a festival/event organiser, providing a stepping-stone to employment.
- Work Integrated Learning
- The Major has a 20 credit point pool subject (TOUR 3003 Visitor Economy Professional Placement) that incorporates a Work Integrated Learning through supervised industry placements. The subject is approximately 231 hours (including a placement with an industry host, professional development and workshops), during which time students gain work-ready skills and undertake professional tasks.
- The subject coordinator will work closely with placement providers to ensure appropriate workplace supervision. The process of liaison involves site visits and meetings. These meetings allow the subject coordinator to discuss: specific details about the placements, the criteria for accepting students, placement constraints and the required procedures for student engagement and management during their placement (e.g. induction, supervision, evaluation, patterns of work, special requirements). During the placement weeks, the subject coordinator will engage in one-on-one student supervision and host liaison management (via zoom/Skype for international placements). The placement weeks also include a suite of evaluation processes throughout, including a mid-year and end of year evaluation undertaken by the host provider, and a mid-year review conducted by the subject coordinator (either online or face-to-face).
