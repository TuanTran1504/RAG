Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Predict from the structure of a xenobiotic, the structures of its probable metabolites including intermediates and final products
Predict the enzymes (including isozymes where known) likely to be involved in the biotransformation of a xenobiotic and its primary metabolites
Understand and correctly use the terminology of the field
Understand and be able to predict the effects of prototype inducers of xenobiotic biotransformation on enzymes present in liver and other organs
Understand and be able to predict the effects of prototype inhibitors of various xenobiotic biotransformation reactions
Understand the role of route of administration on the fate of a xenobiotic or the action of a modulator of xenobiotic transformation
Understand the roles of transporter proteins in directing uptake and efflux of xenobiotics and their metabolites
Understand the basis for interaction between reactive metabolites and cellular macromolecules, and be able to predict the potentially reactive metabolites of a particular xenobiotic
