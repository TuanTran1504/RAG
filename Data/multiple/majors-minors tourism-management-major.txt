- Tourism and travel are among the world’s largest industries, accounting for a quarter of the world’s employment growth and more than 10% of global GDP (World Travel and Tourism Council, 2021). This major provides students with the knowledge and skills required to work within the plethora of careers available in the tourism and travel sectors. Students will learn about the behaviours and motivations of travellers, and how to identify and manage the negative environmental, social, cultural and community impacts of tourism. The major also teaches students about tourism policy and planning, and the management of destinations and the various components of the tourism and travel sector. Students who choose to complete the Visitor Economy Professional Placement subject will complete a tourism work placement, providing a stepping-stone to employment.

- Work Integrated Learning
- The Major has a 20 credit point pool subject (TOUR 3003) Visitor Economy Professional Placement) that incorporate a Work Integrated Learning through supervised industry placements. The subject is approximately 231 hours (including a placement with an industry host, professional development and workshops), during which time students gain work-ready skills and undertake professional tasks.
- The subject coordinator will work closely with placement providers to ensure appropriate workplace supervision. The process of liaison involves site visits and meetings. These meetings allow the subject coordinator to discuss: specific details about the placements, the criteria for accepting students, placement constraints and the required procedures for student engagement and management during their placement (e.g. induction, supervision, evaluation, patterns of work, special requirements). During the placement weeks, the subject coordinator will engage in one-on-one student supervision and host liaison management (via zoom/Skype for international placements). The placement weeks also include a suite of evaluation processes throughout, including a mid-year and end of year evaluation undertaken by the host provider, and a mid-year review conducted by the subject coordinator (either online or face-to-face).
