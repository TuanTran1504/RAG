Academic Handbook Current Edition PHYS 7003 Space Science, Planetary Science and Meteorology Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301249 Coordinator Luke Barnes Opens in new window Description This subject examines the six key priorities of the Australian Space Agency: communication, space debris monitoring, navigation and positioning, Earth observation, space technology research and development, and remote asset management. Students will examine the Sun and Solar System, planetary science, meteorology, and the physics of rockets and satellites. Students will explore the interconnections between the Earth land, ocean, atmosphere, and life of our planet in the era of modern satellite technologies. These include the critical review of our understanding about the cycles of water, carbon, rock, and other materials that continuously shape, influence, and sustain Earth and its inhabitants. Students will also be able to design new models of the cyclical interactions between the Earth system and the Sun, Moon and will discover the fundamental processes which define our Universe and our planet.

Level Postgraduate Coursework Level 7 subject Restrictions Students must be enrolled in a postgraduate program. Assumed Knowledge Knowledge of Mathematics equivalent to 2-unit HSC, and experience with the use of computer software such as Excel or Word would be beneficial. Previous experience of statistics or computer programming will be an advantage but is not essential. Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Scientifically evaluate the overall structure of our cosmic habitat (Earth & its environment).
Assess and recommend appropriate solutions to basic problems in modern space physics regarding gravity and radiations including a direct implication of the Sun�fs future evolution.
Appraise the forces that shape the interior, surface and atmospheres of rocky and gaseous (extra) solar planets.
Apply integrated knowledge of a range of scientific inventories of the Solar System and the Earth�fs weather systems in physical terms
Assess the basics of modern space rocket design including the next generation of micro satellites.
Critique the challenges of launching and maintaining satellites in space.
Evaluate large scale climate changes on Earth and other types of planets. Subject Content This subject will be organised around providing the necessary scientific background for the six priorities of the Australian Space Agency: communication, space debris monitoring, navigation and positioning, Earth observation, space technology research and development, and remote asset management.
