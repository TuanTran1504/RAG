O. Wilson famously described them as the 'little things that run the world'. Besides their ecological importance, many invertebrates are useful to humans, whereas others are harmful to agriculture, human and veterinary health. This subject introduces invertebrate diversity in the context of their ecological and economic importance. It also develops skills necessary to classify and distinguish between the major invertebrate taxa. This subject includes fundamental hands-on laboratory and field studies skills for students with broad career pathways in science (e.g. animal, environmental, forensic and medical sciences) as well as agriculture, environmental management, and education.
