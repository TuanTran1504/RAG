Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 7037 Researcher Engagement and Impact Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 800209 Coordinator Jessica Weir Opens in new window Description Maximising impact requires strategy. In addition to an extensive relationship-building with external parties as well as a general commitment to knowledge translation, achieving impact also means being strategic with research design from the earliest stages of project planning. Who is your research targeted to? What are the broader social aims of your research? Which individuals and organisations might have a stake in the outcomes of your research? What are the relevant disciplinary, policy, economic, industry, and social contexts for your research? What barriers or opportunities exist within these contexts? What social media and other communication platforms are available for you to transfer knowledge? What types of public communication should you engage in, and at what stages of your research? This subject will explore how to design research projects with such questions in mind, by combining collaborative workshops with assessments tailored specifically to your own circumstances. Whatever stage your research is at, you will have the opportunity to produce output that will feed into your broader impact or engagement objectives.
