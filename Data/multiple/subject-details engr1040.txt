Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 1040 Designing for People: Applied Ergonomics Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301286 Coordinator Karen Yevenes Opens in new window Description Ergonomics is the study of the interaction between people, their environments, and their objects. A sound understanding of the principles of ergonomics allows a designer to develop products, systems and environments with optimum product usability and end user safety. In this unit, students are introduced to modelling workshop procedures and undertake their own ergonomic study. Students then build and test a hand-held scale product, and integrate user feedback into their redesign.
