Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 4011 Inclusion in the Early years Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102685 Coordinator Kerry Staples Opens in new window Description Inclusion is both a right and an expectation for all children. Its effectiveness, however, depends upon teachers having the competencies, dispositions and skills to advocate for equity of access, participation and inclusion for children with a broad range of abilities within early childhood settings. In this subject, students reflect on the social construction of disability, policy and research in relation to the identification of additional needs, intervention and inclusion. Students will learn to assess curriculum and environments for learning, and to design, evaluate and communicate inclusive plans. The subject will focus on enhancing quality inclusive early childhood education through responsive adaptation and modification of the environment, curriculum and teaching practices. The importance of forming genuine partnerships with families and collaborating with the team around the child are advocated as essential for effective inclusion.  This subject is included in the Transition Phase of the Bachelor of Education. School Education Student Contribution Band HECS Band 1 10cp Check your fees via the Fees page.
