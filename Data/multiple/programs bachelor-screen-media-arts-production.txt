You will learn to apply independent thinking and creativity to the latest storytelling techniques, and develop your craft in high-end studio and editing facilities. Award-winning academics will work with you to develop conceptual, storytelling and technical skills that cover the breadth of film, television, online and interactive media. You’ll develop the skills to oversee the complete production of a screen media project, from developing creative ideas, to identifying funding sources, organising workflows, scoping production, collaborating with the different roles on a set, producing and editing content, and finally, marketing the finished product.
- This program integrates theory and practice in a way that helps build critical thinking and creative problem-solving, which will enhance your approach to creating unique content and responding to real client briefs. In your first year, you will develop fundamental skills and knowledge in screen media. In your second and third years, you will build on your screen media skills and choose either the Design stream (to enhance visual and interactive skills) or the Journalism stream (to complement your investigative, storytelling and documentary skills). Throughout the degree, you will have opportunities to attend industry events and network with Australia’s most successful practitioners. When you graduate, you will be equipped with a web-based professional portfolio to showcase your skills and expertise, and will be prepared for a bright future in the screen content/communication industry.
