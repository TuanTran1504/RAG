Through case studies, students examine conciliation, mediation and arbitration with a particular focus on advocacy practice in industrial tribunals. An important theme in the subject is the assessment of the contextual and regulatory factors that shape negotiation, bargaining and advocacy practice. This aspect draws on contemporary debates in these spheres most notably concerning the Australian context.
