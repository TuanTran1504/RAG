Through their studies, students will learn to recognise the significance of plant pests (invertebrates, microorganisms and weeds) and their impact on human society and food security, and methods of reducing their damage to plants and plant products.  Major areas of study include: recognition of pests and diseases and assessment of field damage; strategies for reducing pest damage (including legislative, physical, biological, genetic and chemical control methods) and their benefits and limitations; the theory and practice of integrated pest and disease management systems; and issues associated with quarantine and biosecurity.
