Academic Handbook Current Edition TEAC 3003 Community Responsive Pedagogies and Leadership Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 102139 Coordinator Zara Ruggero Opens in new window Description The subject is only offered to students enrolled in the Bachelor of Education (Primary) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education program. This subject is designed to build on students' sociological understandings of primary schooling and how it impacts on First Nation peoples.. The subject builds on experiential, theoretical and curriculum knowledge developed in the course. Schools have a long tradition of working with communities at the 'chalkface' of social change. Such relationships are complex, evolving and spatially/ temporally different because of a local/global sense of place and the socio-political context.  Possibilities for promoting socially just practices for different communities are therefore contingent upon a range of strategies for inclusion. This subject examines theoretical frameworks that can assist in understanding the complexities of these processes and will incorporate a 5 day community engagement activity involving First Nation peoples. This subject is included in the Transition Phase of the Bachelor of Education.
