- Work Integrated Learning (WIL) for international students
- This course will include WIL opportunities that involve using the workplace and community as a site and as a source for learning. WIL partners include various Local Health Districts, hospitals, aged care providers, and other health service providers found within the community. Two units will be focused on WIL, one using workplaces and communities as sources for learning through project-based learning, and the other following the more traditional WIL format of using the workplace and community as a site for learning. Details of the units are as follows:
- Professional Project 1 – this unit will use the workplace as a source of learning, by bringing industry partners to campus to present “wicked problems” that students will then work on solving. Industry partners will then return to, together with the unit coordinator and other academic staff, assess the solutions presented by students, potentially selecting some that can be used in their real healthcare services. Industry partners will be involved in mentoring activities with students while academic staff will support students throughout the process.
- Professional Internship in Health – this unit will use workplace and community as a site for learning and will involve 320h of placement with a healthcare service. Assessment is undertaken by the on-site supervisors using a comprehensive form and supporting documentation and resources. Mid-placement checks with both students and supervisors are undertaken to pre-empt any concerns as well as random checks throughout. Students are required to complete academic assessment tasks, including an e-Portfolio and a workplace product at the end.
