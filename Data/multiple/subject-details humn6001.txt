Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 6001 Transnational Crime and Human Security Threat Credit Points 10 Coordinator Sharon Kwok Opens in new window Description Transnational crime generates serious individual and collective social harm, and poses human security threats at national, regional and international levels. It challenges states, exploits individuals, compromises economies and the environment, destroys civil society, and ultimately weakens democracy. This subject begins by assessing the concepts and definitions of transnational crime. Instead of offering a general overview of transnational crime, this subject focuses on various types of transnational crime and examines their emergence, impact, and control from a human security perspective, by examining how globalisation affects criminal organisations. While considering the security threat that transnational crime and criminal organisations pose at national and global levels, this subject aims to equip students with a holistic understanding of transnational crime beyond conventional criminological perspectives, hence nurturing studentsâ€™ ability to develop just and human security focused policies to prevent and control transnational crime.
