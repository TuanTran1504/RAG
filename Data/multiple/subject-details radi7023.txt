Academic Handbook Current Edition RADI 7023 Applied Obstetric and Gynecological (O&G) Sonography Credit Points 10 Coordinator Catherine Robinson Opens in new window Description This subject aims to provide students with discipline-specific knowledge and skills to practice as a proficient confident O&G sonographer. Within this subject, students will be provided with opportunities to interact with experts in the field to promote a deep appreciation for the broad application of O&G sonography. Students will explore O&G procedures and imaging technologies complementary to clinical decision making. They will learn to enhance clinical practice by considering paediatric and general ultrasound applications relevant to fetal and maternal complications and disease.

For students who complete their clinical training in a NSW public hospital, the necessary legislative requirements will be part of their employment conditions. Clinical training for many of the students will be in a private setting, where the necessary requirements (which are likely to differ from public institutions) will be addressed as needed. Training for some students will occur in states other than NSW (where legislative requirements can be competed if, and when required).
