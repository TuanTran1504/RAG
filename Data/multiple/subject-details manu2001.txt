This subject introduces basic aspects of design and manufacturing, process selection, manufacturing processes, material selection based on material properties and the use of computers in the design process. A project selected allows students to work individually and in a team environment to achieve the final objective which is a workable product. As part of the project, students are asked to develop a product from a page of functional requirements by developing a concept sketch, material selection, detail engineering drawings, process plan and finally making the product in a workshop. At the end of the semester, the products are tested. School Eng, Design & Built Env Discipline Manufacturing Engineering and Technology, Not Elsewhere Classified.
