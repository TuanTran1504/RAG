Specifically, this subject examines classic and current theories and research evidence-base relating to the biological, cognitive, social, emotional, and moral development of children and the implications of these for learning and classroom practice. It includes theoretical perspectives on the brain and learning including memory formation, retention and models of motivation, attention, and knowledge acquisition. This subject dispels common educational neuromyths and focuses on evidence-informed pedagogical practices that support learning, engagement, motivation, and wellbeing in culturally responsive classrooms.
