Students will reflect critically on the key economic processes, theories and ideas.  We study the way economics defines growth and wellbeing and the economic theories of income determination and business cycles that shape macroeconomic policy. Students will form perspectives on globalisation, trade, colonisation and development and the causes of, and solutions to, inequalities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. In the microeconomic component of the subject, we study the way economics understands and models individuals and the consumer, production and firms, markets and market structures, the role of government intervention and regulation, environmental outcomes and policy to control processes of economic power.
