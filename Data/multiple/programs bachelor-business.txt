- The Bachelor of Business harnesses your energy and passion for success. This degree gives you the knowledge to create a career as a business professional. Whether you wish to pursue a corporate role in a global enterprise or start your own business, this program will provide you with the skills to do it. The Bachelor of Business begins with four core subjects: Financing Enterprises, Enterprise Innovation and Markets, Enterprise Leadership, and Enterprise Law. These subjects provide you with the essential business knowledge that will be the platform for your career and equip you with the academic skills that will underpin your success in the degree.
- You will then undertake four professional subjects. The professional subjects are where you begin to shape your future in one of three core business areas: Money, Markets or Management. By learning core business skills within the context of your chosen future you will develop new skills and enhance your employability. Subjects in the professional core will teach you to plan your career, innovate and analyse. You will also be able to explore and apply your skills and knowledge in a work-based learning subject. Through your business degree you will engage critically with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals through your evaluation of economic, social, and environmental enterprise and professional behaviour and your consideration of responsible business practice.
- Ten industry-relevant majors have been created to equip you with expert skills across the three enterprise futures of Money, Markets and Management. The Money majors include Accounting, Applied Finance, Economics, and Property. The Markets majors are Hospitality Management, International Business, Marketing and Sport Management. Management majors are Human Resource Management and Management.
- You will need flexibility to create your career. The Bachelor of Business gives you the flexibility to select eight subjects from anywhere in the University. This means that you can choose a variety of non-business subjects to gain depth and perspective on your enterprise future; you could take a major in another discipline; or you can complete a second major within Business.
