Academic Handbook Current Edition MATH 0017 Mathematics for Health Science (WSTC) Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 900088 Coordinator Rubie Herrera Opens in new window Description This subject is designed to prepare students for further study at university level in the areas of Health Science and, in particular, Nursing. Undergraduate study in Health Science places a particular emphasis on mathematical skills in the workplace and this subject provides a basis for developing those skills. The subject places equal emphasis on both theoretical and practical application of mathematical techniques as would apply in practice in the Health environment.
