Academic Handbook Current Edition MECH 3002 Advanced Mechanics of Materials Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300761 Coordinator Baolin Wang Opens in new window Description This subject builds on the Mechanics of Materials to provide students with knowledge about impacts of deformation, stresses, strains and strength on materials and components essential in understanding how to improve mechanical design. Students' analytic and problem solving skills are developed through analysis of impacts including non-elastic deformation, orientation of the reference axes, and how materials fail. Using knowledge about materials, students evaluate impacts on materials, the mechanisms to control properties of materials, and use mathematical calculations and techniques to determine stresses and strains on simple components. Overall, students develop the capacity to select appropriate materials and improve mechanical design.
