This is a unique accelerated program, where students complete 320 credit points within 3.5 years including a suite of work-integrated learning (WIL) subjects, some being offered in summer session with flexible delivery. In the WIL subjects, each student has an academic supervisor and an industry supervisor to undertake a negotiated WIL activity that aligns with the given WIL theme within a workplace. Students will be recruited by agreed industry partners to their organisation through a selection process after their first year to undertake these WIL subjects. Students who have completed all WIL subjects will receive an exemption of 1040 hours towards completing the Industry Based Learning subject, leaving a total of 160 additional hours required to be undertaken.
