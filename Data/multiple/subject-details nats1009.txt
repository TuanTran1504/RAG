Academic Handbook Current Edition NATS 1009 Human Anatomy and Physiology 1 Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 400868 Coordinator Garry Niedermayer Opens in new window Description This is the first of two subjects covering systematic anatomy and physiology at an introductory level. This subject is designed to provide students in medical science and applied health science programs with an overview of body systems and their functions to ensure a suitable basis for their future studies. The subject studies the basic concepts of biochemistry and histology, general anatomy and physiology of the major body systems including the central and peripheral nervous systems, integumentary system, musculoskeletal system (bones, muscles and joints), special senses and endocrine system. Emphasis will be placed on the interconnection and relationship between structure and function at every level of organisation.
