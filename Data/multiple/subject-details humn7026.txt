Academic Handbook Current Edition HUMN 7026 Knowledge Translation Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 800199 Coordinator Michael O'Connor Opens in new window Description Knowledge translation looks at how knowledge created through research can be applied in real world contexts. It takes research from the theoretical stage (i.e. "that's interesting, but so what?") to the applied stage where it can be used to create real impact.  In this subject, we explore the two main processes of knowledge translation - communication and implementation.  This is a highly collaborative subject where the interdisciplinary group meets to engage in general theoretical discussion and practice various knowledge translation activities based on our various fields of research.
