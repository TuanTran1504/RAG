Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 1046 Human Centred Design Research Methods Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 301280 Coordinator Mauricio Novoa Opens in new window Description This subject introduces Human-Centred Design (HCD) to students as an interactive practice that puts people’s views, behaviour, and their environment at the centre of problem-solving, design and innovation processes.  Students will work on an applied research project that allows them to observe, experiment, gain feedback from participants, and think critically through co-designing to propose new interpretations and solutions for our changing built environment, design artefacts and social habits. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals (UNSDG), this subject’s research methods cover professional skills on ethics, academic literacy, design and research iteration processes, interdisciplinary team approaches, and sustainability. Students will be presented with opportunities to interact with industry and community experts to enhance their understandings and make potential career connections.

Apply research to analyse existing products, built environment, user need, standards, and systems viability using HCD research methods and design, digital and visual literacy skills
Evaluate HCD problems individually and in groups while aligning to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs)
Produce design solutions using design research suitable for use that demonstrate HCD and design process knowledge by practice through design research, prototyping, testing and iterations Subject Content Assessment The following table summarises the standard assessment tasks for this subject.
