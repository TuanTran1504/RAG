- Occupational therapy is a highly regarded field in which you can apply your knowledge and skills to provide therapy for people who, because of illness, injury or circumstances, are limited in their ability to perform everyday tasks. The program promotes the value of human diversity, fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of every client. Occupational therapists find employment in public and private hospitals, rehabilitation centres, insurance companies, schools and large corporations.
- The program in occupational therapy is offered as a Bachelor of Occupational Therapy. The first two years of the program combine studies in occupational therapy with a broad understanding of biomedicine and various health science fields to develop the professional competencies important for ethical and safe practice and high quality care and the skills to work in multidisciplinary teams. The final two years focus predominately on occupational therapy practice skills, practical experience and specialised areas. Evidence-based practice is one of the most important trends in healthcare today and a strong feature of the program.
- An honours stream is available for high performing students. Students may also exit after year 3 with a Bachelor of Health Science degree but are unable to practice as an occupational therapist.
