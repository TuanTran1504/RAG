- Health Promotion extends beyond raising awareness of healthcare issues. It also involves developing and implementing strategies for communities, individuals and policy makers to support good health and wellbeing. Health Promotion graduates help address health inequities in communities, link individuals and communities with healthcare, and assist individuals and communities to follow healthy behaviours, working across sectors and engaging collaboratively with communities to do so. Health promotion projects are as diverse as injury prevention, skin cancer prevention, HIV/AIDS awareness and community development. Health promotion professionals work in diverse settings including healthcare, workplace and educational facilities, community, local, state and federal government, private industry and not-for profit organisations. The major combines studies of health politics and planning, health promotion practice and public health with a comprehensive foundation in the health sciences to develop the professional competencies important for ethical and safe practice. Students will develop the skills required to work in multidisciplinary teams. Evidence-based practice is one of the most important trends in healthcare today and a strong feature of the program. Students in T109 Clinical Science, who would not otherwise have the opportunity to take the 140-hour unit MEDI 3007 Professional Health Placement may choose to do so. This Major will be identified on the Student’s Academic Transcript following completion of the course.
