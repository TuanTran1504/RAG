Academic Handbook Current Edition PROC 3003 Food Product Development Credit Points 10 Legacy Code 300915 Coordinator Christine Hutchison Opens in new window Description This subject is a final year capstone subject where students work in a team environment to apply the knowledge previously gained through their studies in nutrition and food science to develop a novel food product. The entire process of product development will be covered, including: idea generation; collating market, technical and consumer information; consumer surveying to establish the need/desire for a new product; product innovation development; quality testing and packaging. Students will develop specialised knowledge of the total product development system, including the ability to design, develop formulations and evaluation of sensory properties. Final product assessment includes nutritional composition, microbiological analysis, sensory evaluation and labelling compliant with regulations. The project is run in the simulated industry environment; team work among the members plays a key part of the subject.

Level Undergraduate Level 3 subject Pre-requisite(s) NATS 3038 - Quality Assurance and Food Analysis Restrictions Successful completion of 120 credit points Assumed Knowledge Students enrolled in this subject must have previous knowledge of food science principles, food processing, human nutrition, food analysis, sensory evaluation and food quality control systems, plus experience in food formulation and ingredient manipulation coupled with an understanding of nutritional requirements. Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to: Develop specialised knowledge of the total product development system.
Develop skills in problem solving, in terms of product formulation and group dynamics, by working effectively, responsibly and safely in a team to coordinate the tasks required.
Design, conduct and analyse consumer surveys.
Formulate food products, addressing the product design brief and consumer marketing requirements; whilst demonstrating high level food preparation skills and scientific knowledge of the properties of food to create desirable food products.
Safely and competently analyse the product (physical, chemical, microbiological and sensory), also ensuring that it complies with food safety and labelling regulations.
Report and communicate the results of the development process using a range of modes and formats, including large formatted report and PowerPoint presentation.
Investigate and apply statutory regulations in relation to new product development. Subject Content - Product development process
