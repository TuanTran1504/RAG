Academic Handbook Current Edition ENGR 1052 Fundamentals of Mechanics (Block) Credit Points 10 Coordinator Maisha Tabassum Opens in new window Description In this subject students acquire knowledge about the action and interaction of forces, moments and couples in two and three dimensions.  Students then apply this to the analysis of the equilibrium of single bodies, and of trusses, mechanisms, and transversely loaded beams.  In addition, students study the dynamics of a non-rotating body, and a body rotating about a fixed axis.  Further, they study the friction between bodies.  Students conduct experiments to see how the lecture content applies to the real world, and make extensive use of vector algebra.
